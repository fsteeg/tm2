Do you know what it is ,  and where I can get one ?  We suspect you had seen the Terrex Autospade ,  which is made by Wolf Tools .  It is quite a hefty spade , with bicycle - type handlebars and a sprung lever at the rear , which you step on to <head>activate</head> it . Used correctly ,  you should n't have to bend your back during general digging ,  although it wo n't lift out the soil and put in a barrow if you need to move it !  If gardening tends to give you backache ,  remember to take plenty of rest periods during the day ,  and never try to lift more than you can easily cope with .

For neurophysiologists and neuropsychologists ,  the way forward in understanding perception has been to correlate these dimensions of experience with ,  firstly ,  the material properties of the experienced object or event  ( usually regarded as the stimulus )  and ,  secondly ,  the patterns of discharges in the sensory system .  Qualitative Aspects of Experience The quality or modality of the experience depends less upon the quality of energy reaching the nervous system than upon which parts of the sensory system are <head>activated</head> : stimulation of the retinal receptors causes an experience of light ; stimulation of the receptors in the inner ear gives rise to the experience of sound ; and so on . Muller 's  nineteenth - century  doctrine of specific energies  formalized the ordinary observation that different sense organs are sensitive to different physical properties of the world and that when they are stimulated ,  sensations specific to those organs are experienced .  It was proposed that there are endings  ( or receptors )  within the nervous system which are attuned to specific types of energy ,  For example ,  retinal receptors in the eye respond to light energy ,  cochlear endings in the ear to vibrations in the air ,  and so on .

Quantitative Aspects of Experience There are three fundamental dimensions of quantity  in experience :   ( a )  intensity ;   ( b )   ( spatial )  extensity ;  and  ( c )  duration .  At a neurophysiological level , the intensity of an experience is typically reflected in the number of neurones <head>activated</head> ( the phenomenon of recruitment ) and , more specifically , in the firing frequency of the relevant neurones . Extensity  ( for example the size of a patch of light )  usually correlates with the number and spatial distribution of receptors activated .  Finally ,  duration is correlated with the period of time for which the relevant neurones are active .

Extensity  ( for example the size of a patch of light )  usually correlates with the number and spatial distribution of receptors activated .  Finally ,  duration is correlated with the period of time for which the relevant neurones are active .  ( I am leaving aside phenomena such as accommodation , whereby a constant stimulus when sustained may <head>activate</head> the nervous system progressively less intensively , with a corresponding reduction in the perceived intensity of the stimulus . These ,  and other features of adaptation ,  do not invalidate the underlying conceptual framework .  )  The earliest psychophysical observations demonstrated a correlation between the intensity of the physical stimulus and  subjective reports of the intensity of the resultant experience .

These choreographic sentences ,  no matter how short or long ,  broad or narrow ,  high or low must make sense within the total pattern or movement traced on the stage .  This pattern is made not only by the dancers '  feet as they move over the surface but also by the dancers '  bodies as they move through space .  Their limbs , torsos and heads can make straight , angled or rounded lines , usually at one and the same time , according to the natural structure of the dancers ' bones and how they are <head>activated</head> by the muscles . The choreographer must learn the natural functioning of the dancers '  bodies in order to combine steps and poses in a way that gives quality to the whole .  If the dance design is to have physical ,  musical and ,  when necessary ,  dramatic sense ,  would - be choreographers should study how and why Petipa divided his steps into seven categories and then study some examples of how other choreographers have used his ideas .

As de Valois said in a lecture to teachers :  It is better to have a rule to break than no rule at all if chaos is not to reign in the class - room or on the stage .  A choreographer working in the classical style is wise to conform to the traditional principles and rules found valuable through years of experience .  They are based on a refinement of the natural movements made by the bones and joints when <head>activated</head> by the muscles , tendons and ligaments found in any human body . The movements were and still are practised because they are designed to display the body as it moves to the best advantage from the audience 's  point of view .  They were and still are designed to give that style of dance spaciousness ,  calm ,  balance and grace of form so that the lines drawn during the transition from one step an/or pose to another fills the available space in every dimension .

In the case of the human body ,  that steady field is the Earth 's  magnetic field .  The ions in motion are those chemical ions in body fluids and present within body cells .  The <head>activating</head> field producing resonance is the electric and magnetic field set up by an overhead power line or magnetic field producing appliance such as an electric blanket , etc. On this matter ,  some point out that ,  assuming electromagnetic radiation does have an effect ,  it can only proliferate cancers already present .  This view is not convincing given that we all have a latent capacity to develop cancer cells through oncogene gene sectors ;  exposure to fields might reasonably be supposed to accelerate transmutations .

Can body cells be the seat of a human cyclotron effect ?  The cyclotron needs a magnetic field and a transverse AC electric field to pump energy into ions in motion in that field .  There are ions <head>activated</head> by thermal motion in blood and these are always subject to the Earth 's magnetic field . Proximity to a weak 50Hz or 60Hz electric field therefore means that ions in a certain mass range can respond to cyclotron action .  The ions in water and blood happen to be in the critical mass range .

Labour hopes to transform the situation by increasing the number of A - levels to five for the brighter youngsters and providing grants for four - year training courses  ( two years in a Further Education college followed by two with an employer )  for the rest .  These reforms will only achieve their objective if accompanied by the implementation of the 1944 Education Act provision for compulsory part -  or full - time education or training up to the age of 18 .  This clause has never yet been <head>activated</head> . The sharply reduced number of 16 - 18 - year - olds will inevitably lead employers to bid up the wages of that age group to entice young people away from education and into unskilled or semi - skilled jobs .  Employers must be required to release 16 - 18 - year - olds for education and training for at least two days per week .

How do cells become different ?  When I learnt biology ,  I was taught that Weismann ,  although he was right about the independence of germ line and soma ,  had given the wrong answer to this question .  He argued that cells become different because , at the time of cell division , different genes are transmitted to different daughter cells ( he did not use the word gene , but that is what he meant ) ; whereas in fact all body cells contain the same genes , and become different because different genes are <head>activated</head> in different cells . Now it is true that Weismann was mistaken in thinking that different cells receive different genes ,  but his reasons for thinking so are illuminating .  He saw that the alternative was to suppose that cells become different because they are exposed to different external influences .

Although the country may have lost its strategic significance with the collapse of the Soviet Union ,  Washington is nevertheless concerned at the possibility of an unstable radical Islamic state growing up on the borders of the former Soviet Central Asia .  The signal for the collapse of the regime was Mr Najibullah 's  announcement last month that he was ready to step down in favour of a United Nations - appointed interim committee .  It destroyed morale throughout the regime , forcing commanders and party chiefs to <head>activate</head> their tribal links with the Mujahideen and save their skins before the time of reckoning . The effect has been to accentuate divisions between the majority Pushtuns  ( known in the days of the Raj as Pathans )  and the ethnic minorities of the north such as the Tajiks ,  who are kin to the people of the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan across the Amu Darya river .  The minorities have thrown off the Pashtun yoke ,  largely thanks to the military prowess of Commander Ahmed Shah Massoud ,  a Tajik from the Jamiat - e - Islami  ( Islamic Society )  opposition group .

The HT4 cortical cells ,  on the other hand ,  did not habituate to depolarisation .  After trying various neurotransmitters the group found that serotonin could potentiate the cell 's  response  ie  enhance the response to stimulation .  The difference between long and short term memory depends on whether certain NMDA ( N methyl - D - aspartate ) receptors were <head>activated</head> or not. A stronger  ( long )  serotonin stimulus causes the release of amino acids which activate the NMDA receptors ,  leading to long term memory .  A short stimulus gives only a transient NMDA elevation ,  but if the cells are treated with both serotonin and NMDA ,  then long term potentiation could be induced .

We can think of neurons as the chips and the connecting dendrites as the wiring ,  explained Koshland .  He pointed out the importance of having both long and short term memory  you do n't want to clutter up your brain with information that is irrelevant long term ,  he said ,  giving as an example the way you would look at traffic approaching as you crossed a street  you need to recall the situation for only a few seconds .  When you remember something , the chemistry is the same each time every time you see Mr Jones , the same pathway is <head>activated</head> . Scientists believe that often it would be possible to recall lost information by constructing a new access path or connection  especially valuable for stroke victims or others suffering memory loss .  There is some evidence that highly educated people recover more quickly from stroke ,  since they are probably used to accessing more pathways .

Wagner 's   ( 1976 ,  1981 )  theory of habituation ,  discussed at length in Chapter 2 ,  is also a theory of latent inhibition .  It will be recalled that ,  according to this theory ,  a stimulus is held to be fully effective only when it is able to generate the Al  ( primary activation )  state in the node that constitutes its central representation .  A node that is in the A2 ( secondary activation ) state ( either because its stimulus has only recently been presented or because it has been <head>activated</head> internally by means of an excitatory associative link ) will not be able to move into Al . Accordingly ,  a stimulus will be relatively ineffective both when it has itself recently occurred and also when it is presented along with cues that have previously signalled its occurrence .  ( In the case of habituation training ,  these cues will normally be those that constitute the context in which the stimulus has been presented )  .

Estes 1950 ;  Neimark and Estes 1967 )  .  Latent inhibition is held to be a consequence of the formation of associations among these elements .  More specifically , the model makes the usual associative assumption that excitatory links will be established between representations ( of elements ) that are <head>activated</head> concurrently . Repeated presentation of a given stimulus ,  therefore ,  will allow a network of links to be established among the elements that go to make it up  ( particularly strong links being formed among those elements that tend to be sampled frequently )  .  After such training a given element will ,  when the stimulus is applied ,  be the target both of external input and of internal input by way of the associative links that connect it to other elements .

If we accept  ( and the case has been argued in detail with respect to habituation ;  Chapter 2 ,  pp. 503 )  that the    presentation of S2 modify the representation of S1 that is formed ,  then generalization decrement will ensure that little latent inhibition will be evident after S1  S2 pre - exposure .  Kaye et al  .  ( 1988 b ) support this interpretation by demonstrating that the VS pre - exposure treatment will produce perfectly good latent inhibition when the CS used in the conditioning phase is itself vinegar followed by sucrose , an arrangement that should ensure that the same representation of vinegar is <head>activated</head> on both occasions . They further point out that the likelihood of such generalization - decrement effects will depend upon the exact nature of the stimuli  ( some pairs will interact more than others )  and that not all combinations of S1 and S2 can be expected to generate an attenuation of latent inhibition .  Certainly ,  experiments using more orthodox conditioning stimuli  ( tones ,  lights and so on )  have produced only scanty evidence that the presence of S2 during can influence latent inhibition .

Latent inhibition training can be expected ,  therefore ,  to establish a network of associations among the component parts that go to make up the stimulus .  McLaren ,  Kaye ,  and Mackintosh  ( 1989 )  made use of this suggestion in developing their account of latent inhibition .  Their proposal ( see Chapter 3 ) was that the associability of an element <head>activated</head> by external stimulation will be enhanced when this element lacks associative connections . The analysis offered by interference theory is similar ,  but rather simpler  it is that the existence of these  ( within   stimulus )  associations will interfere with the ability of the elements to form new ones .

And a tendency for the responding acquired to  to generalize to  will also explain why discrimination learning which requires the subject to make different responses to the two stimuli should be retarded .  Although the S - R terminology seems well fitted to the case in which  is a verbal label ,  it is possible to dispense with the reliance on the notion of response - produced cues that is central to S - R theory .  As we have seen , modern theories of Pavlovian conditioning assume that stimuli can <head>activate</head> the representations of other events . Such theories can therefore allow that an associatively activated representation may support generalization between stimuli that share the ability to elicit activity in this representation .  Thus both A and B could become directly linked with a representation of stimulus X as shown in Fig 5.10 ( a )  .

Thus B would become capable of activating the US representation  ( and of evoking a CR )  by way of its ability to activate the X representation .  A and B might well have features in common from the outset  ( the c  elements in the figure )  and these will produce primary generalization  training on A will give associative strength to stimulus elements that are present also in B. The X representation functions in just the same way as the c  elements in producing generalization except for the fact that the ability of A and B to activate X is based on prior conditioning .  It should be acknowledged that not all theories of Pavlovian learning are entirely happy with the suggestion that an associatively <head>activated</head> representation can form an excitatory link with the ( directly <head>activated</head> ) representation of some other event . In particular ,  Wagner 's   ( 1981 )  theory  ( see Chapter 1 )  asserts that the state of activation produced by an associative link  ( A2 )  is different from that produced by the stimulus itself  ( the A1 state )  .  When one  representation  ( node in Wagner 's  terminology )  is in A2 and another in A1 ,  the latter may form an inhibitory link with the former .

Stimuli A and B may be regarded as physically similar to the extent that they share common ,  c  ,  elements .  The mechanism responsible for mediated generalization does nothing to increase the number or proportion of such elements and thus those wanting to cite mediated generalization as a characteristic of concept formation can assert that ,  in a very real sense ,  the similarity of the stimuli has not been changed .  But when it comes to the issue of how a given physical stimulus is actually perceived , we have chosen to represent this in terms of the central representational elements that it <head>activates</head> . The percept initially evoked by A ,  therefore ,  must be equated with the  a  and c  elements that it activates unconditionally ,  After training ,  however ,  presentation of A activates not only these but also elements that in other circumstances are unconditionally activated by stimulus X. The pattern of central representation  ( and thus ,  by one definition ,  the percept )  is changed by experience ,  making the phenomenon an instance of perceptual learning .

The central question in terms of the diagram used in Fig. 5.11 ( a )   ( see also Fig. 5.10 )  is why experience of A and B should reduce the effectiveness of the c  elements in producing generalization between these stimuli .  The critical aspect of differentiation theory in this context is its assertion that exposure to A and B will lead to an increase in the number of distinctive features that can be detected .  This must mean , in terms of the figure , an increase in the number of a and b elements <head>activated</head> by the stimuli , something that can be represented diagrammatically in more than one way . Figure 5.11 ( b )  shows an increase in the areas a  and b  with a consequent reduction in the proportion  ( although not the absolute number )  of c  elements activated by a stimulus .  figure 5.11 ( c )  presents a slightly different possibility in which the sizes of  the A and B circles have not been changed .

Figure 5.11 ( b )  shows an increase in the areas a  and b  with a consequent reduction in the proportion  ( although not the absolute number )  of c  elements activated by a stimulus .  figure 5.11 ( c )  presents a slightly different possibility in which the sizes of  the A and B circles have not been changed .  There is no net increase in the number of elements <head>activated</head> by a given stimulus but the circles have been moved apart , indicating not only an increase in the number of unique elements <head>activated</head> by a stimulus but a corresponding decrease in the number of common elements <head>activated</head> . It is not clear if either of these possibilities accurately represents the full implications of Gibson 's   ( 1969 )  differentiation theory ,  but both are capable of predicting the required result .  * Comparing the scheme shown in fig. 5.11 ( b )  with that of Fig. 5.11 ( a )  ,  we might expect that the presence of the extra active a  elements would produce more effective overshadowing of the c  elements during training with A.

Another example illustrating the importance of cytoplasmic factors in continually controlling gene activity comes from fusing mature muscle cells with cells of a completely different type .

The egg was then allowed to develop and all the cells of the embryo now contained multiple copies of the growth hormone gene and its new promoter .  Shortly after birth , the mouse was fed water containing traces of metal , so <head>activating</head> the injected construct ; the result was a mouse almost twice the size of a normal mouse , and was affectionately labelled Supermouse . The growth hormone gene had been turned on in all the cells throughout the body and the increased production of the growth hormone had resulted in increased growth .  Supermouse is known as a transgenic mouse .

The state of a cell can ,  in principle ,  be described by its genetic activity  which genes are switched on and off .  Development can in this sense be viewed in terms of the changing networks of gene activity in  different  cells .  Activation of one gene can lead to the synthesis of a protein which <head>activates</head> some genes and inhibits others , which in turn may control yet other genes . It is not yet clear just how complex these networks of gene activity are .  One possibility is that there are master genes whose products control the activity of many others .

But what commits the muscle to this final pathway and what ensures that all the necessary genes are turned on at the same time ?  In the case of muscle it seems that there is a master gene controlling the expression of all the main genes ,  known as myogenin and it is always switched on in mature muscle cells .  Its special property is that it can <head>activate</head> most of the genes that are required in the mature muscle . The myogenin gene has been isolated and can be introduced into non - muscle cells where it becomes integrated into their DNA .  The effect of introducing just this one gene is to switch off some genes and to set in train a sequence of gene activation so that the cell develops into a muscle cell with all the appropriate proteins  master gene is an appropriate description .

Initial experiments were performed on porcine platelets stimulated by thrombin but subsequently many substances  ( secretagogues )  have been found to provoke platelet aggregation :  ADP ,  adrenaline and collagen as well as thrombin provoked release of 5 - hydroxytryptamine and nucleotides from platelets  ( Mills et al ,  1968 )  .  In addition ,  immune complexes  ( Humphrey  Jaques ,  1955 )  ,  arachidonic acid  ( Kaplan et al ,  1979 )  and thromboxane A 2   ( Hamberg et al ,  1975 )  cause platelet release .  More recently , the degranulating action of platelet - <head>activating</head> factor has been demonstrated ( Chignard et al , 1979 ; McManus et al , 1979 ) . Some secretagogues  ( e.g. ,  ADP )  stimulate the release of certain granules  ( dense bodies ,  some  - granules but not the lysosomal granules )  ,  whereas thrombin stimulates secretion of all types of granule including lysosomes  ( Holmsen ,  1977 )  .  In addition to these physiological stimuli  many non - physiological stimuli stimulate platelet degranulation including calcium ionophores  ( Gerrard et al ,  1974 )  ,  lectins  ( Greenberg  Jamieson ,  1974 )  and latex and viral particles  ( Holmsen ,  1977 )  .

Thromboxane A 2  is a more powerful pro - aggregatory substance in platelets than the endoperoxides ,  and it has been proposed that it is the arachidonic acid metabolite that mediates platelet aggregation and the release reaction  ( Hamberg et al ,  1975 )  .  Whether platelet endo - peroxides have a proaggregatory role in their own right or only when converted to thromboxane A 2  has been the subject of many studies  ( Bunting et al ,  1983 )  .  However , from experiments using thromboxane synthetase inhibitors it appears that when platelets are <head>activated</head> and the prostaglandin cascade is triggered by release of endogenous arachidonic acid then the endoperoxides generated exert their proaggregatory effects by their conversion to the more potent compound thromboxane A 2 . However ,  when the thromboxane generation is suppressed it is probable that endoperoxides can be proaggregatory themselves  ( Bunting et al ,  1983 )  .  It has been proposed that endoperoxides and thromboxane A 2  activate platelets by acting as calcium ionophores ,  hence mobilising intracellular free calcium  ( Gerrard et al ,  1978 )  .

In this way the activation of  platelets by prostaglandins resembles that produced by ADP and adrenaline .

There are a variety of sulphonylurea agents available for the therapy of diet - failed non - insulin - dependent diabetic subjects ,  varying mainly in their half - life and mode of excretion .  In addition to their hypoglycaemic action it is probable that some or all of these compounds may have antiplatelet effects .  Thus gliclazide depresses various parameters of platelet function in vitro and appears to inhibit arachidonate release from platelet phospholipids ( Tsuboi et al , 1981 ) and to <head>activate</head> platelet adenylate cyclase leading to increased levels of cyclic AMP ( Lagarde et al , 1975 ) . In addition ,  ex vivo  platelet aggregation to ADP and adrenaline was significantly reduced in diabetic subjects treated for up to a year with therapeutic doses of gliclazide  ( Poari et al ,  1979 )  .  These authors considered that the antiplatelet action observed was unrelated to effects on glycaemic control as the two effects were dissociated in time  ( Poari et al ,  1979 )  .

Of course the actions of carcinogens on methylase activity in a test - tube may not reflect what happens in tissues exposed to those chemicals .  But it has recently been shown quite independently by Andrew Feinberg and Bert Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University that the DNA of tumour cells is much less methylated than that of normal cells from the same tissue .  All of which lends circumstantial weight to the idea that oncogenes may be <head>activated</head> by stripping them of their methyl groups and also explains the common observation that tumour cells may sometimes express inappropriately characteristics of other tissue cells . Alert readers of Monitor will have remembered a recent report on the experimental use of a demethylating drug for an inherited anaemia  (  New Scientist  ,  vol 96 ,  p 725 )  .

In man ,  there are three such chromosomes :  chromosomes 14 ,  2 and 22 .

At the same time they <head>activate</head> the rearranged DNA so that large quantities of antibody protein are produced from it . In the perversion of this process that typically occurs in Burkitt 's  lymphoma cells ,  any of three chromosomes containing the antibody genes ,  instead of reorganising their own DNA ,  exchange some DNA with chromosome 8 .  This led George Klein ,  of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden ,  to suggest  ( Nature  ,  vol 294 ,  p 213 )  that these translocations might not just activate the antibody genes on the normal rearranged DNA  they might also activate a proto - oncogene on chromosome 8 .

Their suspicions were borne out by a careful analysis of six different tumours ;  in each case the viral  promotor  turned out ,  as expected ,  to have inserted itself next to the proto - oncogene myc  .  This result made myc  the obvious gene to look for in other lymphomas  and led to its identification on chromosome 8 .

This mobility gap separates the occupied delocalised states that contain the mobile electrons  ( and are so - called precisely because they can move around in the semiconductor )  from vacant delocalised states in higher Landau levels .  At low enough temperatures the gap is insurmountable ,  and dissipative scattering  ( with loss of momentum )  is impossible because there are no vacant delocalised states that an electron has sufficient energy to reach .  On the other hand , occupied localised states , confined to limited regions of the semiconductor , do exist adjacent to vacant localised states , at energies just below EF , and their electrons can move by thermally - <head>activated</head> hopping between sites . But the probability for this to occur decreases very rapidly with decreasing temperature .  So at low enough temperatures ,  with the gate voltage ,  Vg  ,  chosen to put EF  in a mobility gap ,  all the current is in effect carried by electrons that cannot be dissipatively scattered ,  and the resistance falls to zero .

The gentlest way of doing this is to use the effect of the deprivation of something desired ,  and where the training of children is concerned ,  that something need be nothing other than the temporary withholding of manifestations of love .  It is believed ,  as already mentioned ,  that one of the greatest pleasures for a child comes from the security it feels when it knows that it is loved ,  and it is the ability to withhold manifestations of that love for a little while ,  or threaten so to do ,  that provides a non - violent means of securing acquiescence when it is required .  To advocate the starting of the process on a very young child might appear to be heartless , but the overriding need to generate within the child mind the beginning of a conscience and the instinctive urge to <head>activate</head> it , must be the guiding factor . The accusation ,  that person has no conscience ,  carries a condemnation of character ,  but the real culprit is the society which has failed to raise to a position of the utmost importance in the public mind ,  the fact that the human conscience is the very rock - bottom foundation on which civilisation rests .  The control which the withholding of love gives to a parent emphasises how tremendously important it is that a child should be genuinely loved in the first place .

The fluid phase of the body is a superb electrolyte that contains many extremely active biological species ,  especially enzymes ,  and components that are able to produce free radicals and other reactive species .  As a result ,  there are very few materials which are inert in the body and indeed it may be argued that none are truly inert in this context .  On the other hand , as the presence of a splinter of wood in the finger readily proves , tissues have very effective sensors for foreign objects , and defence mechanisms are readily <head>activated</head> . Although the immunological rejection processes that occur with organ transplants do not occur with synthetic materials ,  a complex series of reactions are available to deal with any invading object and biomaterials can be treated in much the same way as invading bacteria ,  setting up inflammatory processes .  The science of biomaterials and the success of future applications depends upon the improved understanding of the various phenomena that are associated with these interfacial reactions ,  collectively described under the heading of biocompatibility .

The voltage on pin 3 if IC5 stays ,  therefore ,  below that on pin 2 and the output at pin 6 remains low .  For a sustained output from IC2 however ,  capacitor C5 is enabled to charge up to a level exceeding that on pin 2 of the op.amp and the output switches high ,  so    turning transistor TR5 on and operating the relay which closes RLA1 contacts .  This closure is only momentary because of the differentiating action of the coupling components capacitor C6 and resistor R21 , and the rest of the circuit is then <head>activated</head> in the way already explained . The use of the relay at this point may seem a bit odd as the switching could be electronically activated ,  but the use of a mechanical relay introduces a small but desirable time variation  ( as well as possible bounce !  )  in the duration of the relays closure and so helps in enhancing the random operation of IC6 during the short time that the VCO is producing its high frequency output .  Only the function of diode D18 remains to be mentioned .

The immunity enjoyed by clownfish from the venomous tentacles of the anemone has only recently become properly understood .

The answer was found during detailed studies of the trigger mechanism which <head>activates</head> the anemone 's nematocysts or stinging cells . The anemone was found to be triggered into action by the protein - based mucus covering most fish and invertebrates and therefore stimulated into stinging by the taste of its prey .  To counteract this ,  clownfish have adopted a dual strategy to deceive the anemone .

It 's  light enough to carry around ,  tipping the scales at just under 5lbs ,  but with the help of large rubber pads on the base it should stay put on stage .  Power is supplied by a 12 volt AC mains adaptor and to prevent accidental unplugging from this type of lightweight plug BOSS have included a cable hook on the back panel to secure the cord .  Alongside the power socket are a pair of sockets from which to remotely switch the effect bypass and to take the ME - 6 from program into manual mode , where each of the 6 pedals <head>activates</head> individual effects , making the ME - 6 work just like a series of ordinary pedals . There 's  also a socket for connecting an expression pedal ,  to allow real time control over your volume .  Hooking up the Boss FV 300L pedal to this socket inserts into the effects chain after the compressor ,  distortion and noise suppressor but before the delay ,  chorus reverb and master ;  this allows the reverb and delay to decay naturally ,  instead of being suddenly cut off when the patch or volume level changes .

Connecting the ME - 6 up to an amp ,  power amp or mixer is as easy as connecting any effect pedal ,  and once hooked up the ME - 6 can store 25 different effect combinations in five memory banks .  Each effect patch is identified by a combination of bank number and patch LED ;  the former appears in the value/bank readout while the patch is indicated by the relevant pedal .  BOSS have set up the ME - 6 to work in two different ways : it can be left to recall programmed patches or , by using the manual programming button , be set to operate like a series of pedals with each footswitch <head>activating</head> an effect in real time . As previously mentioned ,  the top panel display has a series of boxes with a description of the effect and a status LED showing if the effect is on or off .  This works in both manual and program modes ,  although in manual mode the bank select footswitch becomes the reverb on/off switch .

This works in both manual and program modes ,  although in manual mode the bank select footswitch becomes the reverb on/off switch .  Back in program mode ,  operating the ME - 6 begins by stepping on the bank switch to select a bank ;  this causes the value/bank LED to flash .  You then press the relevant patch pedal to set the bank number and repress the relevant patch pedal to <head>activate</head> the chosen sound . In general use the ME - 6 is very user - friendly ,  and this simplicity carries over into its programming .  Modifying one of the factory patches is very simple to do ,  even though the parameters for adjustment are limited .

When an emotionally articulate speaker wants to convey to me ,  not the fact that he is sad ,  but in what way and to what degree ,  his language becomes rhythmic and metaphorical ,  pulls me to his viewpoint to visualize his situation becomes a poetry which infects me with his melancholy and a rhetoric stirring me to help him ,  and afterwards perhaps I find myself regretting having committed myself to an action in his interests rather than my own .  He does not describe his emotions ,  he calls them up ;  if anything is described ,  it is the situation which excites them .  Imaginative writers know as an important item in their craft , that the way to convey emotion with most lucidity and particularity is to choose the apt words , not for the emotion itself , but for the image or scene which <head>activates</head> it . Nor does their command of verbal symbolism ,  the only medium in which one can even pretend to be describing inward states objectively ,  give them any advantage over painters and musicians .

What has not been known ,  until now ,  is the nature of the mechanism by which this occurs .

Maybe for a short time somebody takes a free course at the great university of misery ,  and pays attention to the things he sees with his eyes and hears with his ears .  Doing this ,  he will perhaps have learned more than he can tell .  What he had learnt in the Borinage was that human suffering of the most basic sort somehow <head>activated</head> his creative energies , as well as enabling him to gain access to the depths of his own nature . He loved the superb art of the Dutch Golden Age ,  but he wanted to master a different ,  rougher ,  Adamistic art ,  purposely naive ,  one that satisfied his demands for simplicity and truth and vindicated his distaste for luxury .  It had to be an art that did not separate him from the uncultured poor but was founded in them ,  gathering them to him in a home of art they could all share ,  a home that sheltered and consoled ;  a warm place .

Proposals for syllabuses based on this reduced notion of communication also illustrate how the potential for change inherent in new ideas is stifled by assimilation into established patterns of thinking .  The syllabus is still conceived of as a collection of atomistic linguistic elements even though they are now functionally rather than formally defined .  It is still regarded as a preconceived construct which incorporates goals for learning , and its relationship with a methodology which <head>activates</head> the immediate process of learning remains as undefined as before . But the idea of communicative competence arises from a dissatisfaction with the Chomskyan distinction between competence and performance and essentially seeks to establish competence status for aspects of language behaviour which were indiscriminately collected into the performance category .  Now it seems reasonable to suggest that the competence/performance distinction might also mark the division of responsibility between syllabus and methodology ,  with the former specifying the knowledge to be acquired and the latter providing conditions for its behavioural realization .

What is required is that the language which is pedagogically presented should be a projection of that which actually occurs as recorded by the computer analysis of text .  I made the point earlier that descriptive facts about actual usage do not necessarily determine what is to be included in a language course .  The abstractions of a type description may be preferred on occasions in that they <head>activate</head> more effectively the process of learning . Consider ,  for example ,  that type of syntactic structure which Chomsky refers to as the kernel sentence ,  of which the following are examples :  The birds are singing .

And this is something which computer analysis of a corpus cannot of course determine .   Notice that the principle of contextual plausibility allows legitimacy to expressions which arise in the contrived contexts of the classroom .  If it is allowed that such contrivance is pedagogically desirable as <head>activating</head> the process of learning , then it sets its own conditions for normality . The crucial point is that such expressions should be warranted by conceptual and communicative purposes recognized as having point in classroom activity .  These purposes do not ,  however ,  have to correspond with those which are current or authentic uses of language in the world at large .

This common knowledge of shared experience and conventionally sanctioned reality can be called schematic  knowledge :  it is the knowledge which is acquired as a condition of entry into a particular culture or sub - culture .   Schematic knowledge ,  then ,  is a necessary source of reference in use whereby linguistic symbols are converted into indices in the process of interpretation .  But we should note , too , that language development itself , the acquisition of knowledge of symbolic meanings , is <head>activated</head> by the need to extend schematic knowledge so as to cope more effectively with the social environment . We learn language in order to manage our affairs in the world we find ourselves in .  Language is the means of initiation into the conventions of conceptualization and communication which define particular cultures .

Formal education extends this process by providing guidance into different ways of conceiving of the world and different ways of conveying these concepts in modes of description ,  argument ,  and so on .  Particular subjects on the curriculum can be seen as different sub - cultures in which reality is variously reformulated .  But if it is the case that language learning is activated by the socio - cultural purpose of schematic extension , that we learn language in order to get a better grasp of the world so that we can turn it to our advantage , then it would seem to follow that a central problem in the teaching of a foreign language lies in the provision of some comparable <head>activating</head> purpose . In other words ,  we need to identify areas of schematic knowledge which the learners will accept as independently relevant and worth acquiring so that the learning of the language is seen as the necessary means to a desired end .  If this is so ,  the first question to be asked in designing a language course should not be What language do we need to teach ?  but rather What do we need to teach that will stimulate the learning of language ?

Rightly or wrongly ,  the investing public ,  and others ,  do not see going concern qualifications as purely objective assessments of the distribution of future cash flows designed to aid investors in their portfolio choice .  They see them as having wider connotations ,  which may include casting doubt on both management competence and the financial statements '  integrity .  For these reasons , client managements are unlikely to welcome a going concern qualification , and their concerns may well be reinforced if such a qualification restricts management freedom of action , possibly by allowing debt covenants to be <head>activated</head> , restricting the freedom to pay dividends , and so on . It may well be that risk - taking companies are managed by risk - taking individuals with powerful personalities .  Such individuals are likely to react adversely to anything they perceive as criticism of either their company or themselves ,  and may react by penalising the auditor by directing lucrative consultancy contracts elsewhere or even changing auditors .

On the basis of extensive research in a number of congregations in the United States ,  Peter Wagner has postulated an estimate of ten per cent who are either effectively or potentially gifted as evangelists .  If this percentage potential could be considered to hold true outside the USA ,  we would certainly have to ask of the great majority of congregations ,  What has happened to your ten per cent ?  If it exists at all , their efforts must be going unrecognised , or have been rendered inoperative , or were never <head>activated</head> in the first place .

The child should get up ,  go to the lavatory to finish urinating ,  and then with the help of the parents change the bed and reset the alarm .

Cohort Theory views word recognition  ( for speech input )  as a bottom - up process of eliminating possible candidates by de - activation .  This is in contrast with its predecessor  ( Logogen Theory )  which assumes activation of only a single lexical item .  According to Marslen - Wilson and Welsh , a set of potential word candidates ( the cohort ) is <head>activated</head> during the earliest phases of the word recognition process solely on the basis of bottom - up sensory information . That is ,  all words sharing the same initial sound characteristics become activated in the system .  As the system detects mismatches between initial bottom - up sensory information and the top - down information about the expected sound representation of words generated by context ,  inappropriate candidates within the initial cohort are de - activated .

It is often possible to identify the characteristic eggs from a faecal sample ,  but regular treatment against this and other similar parasites is usually deemed preferable .   The embryonated infective eggs or larvae of the dog roundworm ,  Toxocara canis are ingested by the dog  ( 1 )  and migrate to the body tissues  ( 2 )  such as the kidneys .  Unfortunately , the larvae usually enter the tissues of developing foetuses ( 3 ) and localise in their intestines , being <head>activated</head> by the pregnancy . After the birth of the puppies the larvae can also migrate into the puppies '  system and infect them through the mother 's  milk  ( 4 )  The worms mature passing eggs in the puppies '  faeces which are consumed by the mother and can reinfect her  ( 5 )  .  Alternatively ,  larvae which fail to establish themselves and are passed out in the faeces ,  may find another host and begin producing eggs .

Tretorn ,  in filing its complaint ,  believes that the EC Commission 's  lawyers may have missed the significance of the word in dispute  ( type )  because the LTA 's  previous ball agreement ,   ( ie the one that the EC Commission was asked to consider )  contained no written reference to pressureless tennis balls ,  therefore ensuring that it could not be party to such vital information .  So on February 6th of this year ,  while Mr Dubois was closing his file and writing to the LTA accordingly ,  Tretorn ,  having considered its position ,  went ahead with its complaint to the EC Commission. Tretorn 's action was <head>activated</head> , following correspondence in December between Tretorn 's President , Michael MacCaughey and the LTA 's National Events and Tournaments Manager , Gavin Fletcher , copies of which have come into our possession . In Fletcher 's  letter of 3rd December ,  he states ,  All professional tournaments in Britain have traditionally been played with pressurised tennis balls If Tretorn wish to bid for tournaments in this Category  ( Category A )  ,  they might assume that a bid from a company producing pressurised balls is likely to succeed .

As you will have noticed ,  the strategies we have reviewed have been operating back along the stress cycle  ( as shown in Figure 1 on page 70 )  at points nearer and nearer the source .  If you imagine stress as being in hot water then there are roughly three stages in its creation .  First the tap is turned on ( demand rises ) ; then the water gets hot ( injunctions <head>activated</head> ) ; finally stress occurs ( withdrawal , anger and tension arise ) . Our coping strategies have been listed in reverse order .  If you ca n't do anything better ,  keep mopping up.

Determine randomly which characters are the targets of which darts ;  no character can be a target for more than three unless he is standing right in front of the chest  ( e.g. ,  raising the lid )  .  If the chest is forced open ,  the same trap will be triggered ,  save that there 's  no chance of defusing it with the extra lock - turn .  The second chest has an identical trap , save that this time the poison in the darts is Elfbane , and it has a second trap which will be <head>activated</head> only if the chest is forcibly opened . Inside this chest is a delicate glass globe packed with Yellow Mould spores ,  and if the chest is tipped up ,  broken  into ,  etc. ,  this will release its deadly contents in a 10 - yard radius .  If the adventurers are successful in picking the lock ,  this trap wo n't be activated ,  but they will have to be very careful taking out the money without breaking the glass sphere  ( no test needed ,  but you should roll dice as if you were making some secret test just to scare the players )  .

Both had become convinced that papal jurisdiction had been wrongful ,  and now wished to make use of the supremacy to strengthen the monarchy .  Their true intentions were revealed by their promotion of the 1536 Act Extinguishing the Authority of the Bishop of Rome ;  by their dissolution of the smaller monasteries ;  and by their execution of prominent opponents of their policy ,  such as Sir Thomas More ,  Bishop John Fisher ,  and the London Carthusians .  These moves convinced Pope Paul III that Henry 's disobedience was serious , and in an attempt to <head>activate</head> an earlier bull of excommunication against the king , he lent his support to the Northern rebels during the Pilgrimage of Grace . Henry 's  anti - papalism was based on the belief that the pope had wrongfully usurped the spiritual and temporal power which had traditionally belonged to the kings of England ,  and while he therefore rejected the pope 's  claim to jurisdiction in England ,  he was prepared to regard him as the rightful Bishop of Rome .  Others ,  however ,  including Cromwell and Archbishop Thomas Cranmer ,  were much more vehement in their condemnation of the papacy ;  attracted by the new ideas and reforming zeal of the continental Protestants ,  they argued that the papacy had falsified the word of  God and distorted true religion .

The difference is only in the kind of task and size of hardware .  For example ,  in the case of starting up a machine at a control panel the operator will be given the instructions and   asked to provide a verbal commentary as he actuates the various controls and checks the various indications ,  this is a talk through .  On the other hand , a maintenance check of a series of related machines may involve moving to and fro between them while <head>activating</head> this and that , this is a walk through . The operating instructions/task description can be modified if the analysis reveals any problems from the operator 's  point of view ;  anything which the designer may have omitted or any difficulties the operator has in moving around ,  manipulating controls or checking information presentations .  Ultimately ,  the machine layout or interface design may be modified to make the operating instructions easier to follow .

With the handing over to the Council of Europe in 1960 of the social and cultural responsibilities it had inherited from the Treaty of Brussels ,  it seemed that to all intents and purposes WEU had become moribund .

Some of the information was unreliable and amounted to a considerable wastage in air dropped ordnance and flying hours by launching bombing and strafing missions over dead jungle .  Army Intelligence and Police Special Branch informant networks allowed British South East Asia Command  ( SEAC )  to implement effective tactical plans to block and hit communist bandits  transiting  through the jungle towards hard civilian and military objectives .  As the Commanding Officer of 1 Squadron was also the Senior Strike Leader at Tengah , he had the task of <head>activating</head> operations as directed by SEAC . The Lincolns played an integral part in the overall harassment of the communist offensive campaign and were effectively the only permanent heavy bomber unit in Malaya .  Bombing sorties required exceptional skill and technical accuracy on the part of the Lincoln aircrews ,  particularly the navigation plotters and bomb aimers as most bombing missions required ordnance to be dropped on an exact point as opposed to the more conventional method of carpet bombing large areas .

More accurately ,  they launched an attack on the idea that activity in the autonomic nervous system was a sufficient condition for emotional experience .  The attack was based on a number of strands of evidence ,  including the fact that activation of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system was too diffuse to underpin the range of subtle emotional experiences of which we are capable ,  and the observation that severing the spinal cord in dogs does not prevent them displaying facial signs of emotion when provoked in an appropriate way .  As an alternative , Cannon proposed a centralist theory in which emotion was seen as the result of <head>activating</head> specific mechanisms in the central nervous system . However ,  his evidence did n't permit particularly precise localization within the brain .  It was n't until Papez  ( 1939 )  published his theory of emotion that the field really moved again .

It would certainly be naive just to assume that nerve cells are the same in molluscs as in people ,  but fortunately it is possible to rely on more than assumption .  The advantage of this sort of work is that the descriptions of cellular mechanisms are very detailed and this provides a good basis for determining whether the same cellular mechanisms are available in mammals .  For example , plasticity seems to depend on identifiable ion channels and catalytic molecules that <head>activate</head> or inhibit these channels . It is possible to use advanced biochemical techniques to look for comparable ion channels and catalytic units in the mammalian brain ,  without directly studying the role of cells in learning .  The problem with this approach is that it does n't allow for the possibility that there are additional cellular mechanisms of plasticity in mammals ,  that have evolved to underpin our greater learning abilities .

Each of the input neurons connects to every output neuron .  Output neurons can be activated in one of two ways ,  either by the output pattern generator line ,  or by the input cells .  The input cells are <head>activated</head> only by sensory input . The system is designed so that it will learn to generate output patterns in response to input patterns .  It can do this because the capacity of an input neuron to activate any of the output neurons increases every time the output pattern generator activates the output neuron simultaneously with external activation of the input neuron .

What emerges from this work is the complexity of the interactions between components of the system .  For example ,  loading the stomach with food or water directly has some satiating effect ,  but not as great as when the substance is also allowed to pass into the intestine or has previously passed through the mouth .  These findings raise another problem with stimulation methods , which is that the effects of stimulating at individual points in a system are only readily interpretable when the effects of <head>activating</head> separate parts of a system are additive . That is to say ,  the effects of activating two components together have to be the sum of the effects of activating either in isolation .  If this does n't occur with a relatively simple system like the peripheral mechanisms controlling appetite ,  there must be some doubt about how often this condition is satisfied in the central nervous system .

A further problem comes in deciding how to interpret differences in the amount of activity elicited by a set of conditions .  Does the brain use all of this information ,  or does it work on a trigger basis so that ,  once a level of activity has been exceeded ,  the actual level is irrelevant ?  For example , if a cell doubles its discharge rate under one set of conditions but quadruples under another , does that difference affect how subsequent levels in the circuit respond so that one group of cells is excited by the first set of conditions but a second group is <head>activated</head> by the second set ?

For example ,  edges tend to activate the visual system more than areas of uniform brightness .

Independently of the discovery of X -  ,  Y -  ,  and W - cells came the demonstration of multiple representations of the visual field in the secondary visual cortex .  This is most clearly seen in studies of the primate visual cortex  ( Maunsell and Newsome 1987 )  .  Visual field representations are mapped by sampling successive locations in the visual cortex with a microelectrode and , at each location , determining where you have to place a stimulus in the visual field to <head>activate</head> single cells at that location . You find that cells in adjacent parts of the visual cortex are activated by stimulation in adjacent parts of the visual field .  The cortex is said to be retinotopically mapped .

Cooperative interaction between c -  myc  and bcl - 2  proto - oncogenes Abdallah Fanidi ,  Elizabeth A. Harrington  Gerard I. Evan THE bcl - 2 proto - oncogene is <head>activated</head> by translocation in a variety of B - lymphoid tumours and synergizes with the c - myc oncogene in tumour progression . The mechanism of synergy is unclear but bcl - 2  expression inhibits apoptosis ,  a property presumably pertinent to its proto - oncogenic mode of action .  We have shown that the c  - myc  gene is a potent inducer of apoptosis ,  in addition to its established role in mitogenesis .

Expression of Bcl - 2 completely inhibits the onset of apoptosis in serum - deprived Rat - 1 cells after c - Myc activation ,  as shown in Fig. 2 .  It is important to determine whether Bcl - 2 blocks c - Myc - induced proliferation as well as apoptosis :  the synergy between c - Myc and Bcl - 2 can easily be rationalized if Bcl - 2 blocks only the apoptotic function of c - Myc and leaves its mitogenic activity unaffected .  We examined the mitotic rate of Rat - 1/c - Myc - ER cells that were proliferating in low serum under the influence of - oestradiol - <head>activated</head> c - Myc , with and without Bcl - 2 expression . A proportion of the cells without Bcl - 2 died before undergoing division ,  as previously described ,  and thus could not be scored .  We excluded such cells from our analysis and studied 100 of the remaining cells ,  chosen at random ,  through their first divisions .

Our results demonstrate that acquisition of constitutive Bcl - 2 expression is an example of such a mutation .  Bcl - 2 mitigates the apoptotic effects of deregulated c - Myc expression without affecting its ability to promote continuous cell growth ,  so providing a mechanistic basis for the oncogenic synergy between these two proto - oncogenes .  The interaction between c - Myc and Bcl - 2 differs from the usual form of oncoprotein cooperation as observed between c - Myc and <head>activated</head> Ras in that , although c - Myc/Bcl - 2 fibroblasts proliferate continuously in the absence of mitogens , they neither appear to be morphologically transformed nor to form foci in monolayer culture ( Fig. 1 ) . The interaction between c - Myc and Bcl - 2 thus represents a novel type of oncogene cooperation ,  undetectable by classical transformation - focus assays .  Further characterization of the growth and death of cells containing various combinations of activated c -  myc ,  ras  and bcl   - 2 oncogenes should provide insights as to how the various attributes of these three classes of oncogene interact .

Consistent with this idea ,  Myc mutants with deletions of either helix - loop - helix or leucine zipper domains did not show any activity ,  though positive controls are not available for these mutants  ( data not shown )  .  The transactivation domain of Myc maps to the 177 N - terminal residues ,  consistent with the mapping of this domain in GAL4 - Myc chimaeras in mammalian cells .  The deletion mutant Myc N ( retaining residues 178 to 439 ) fails to <head>activate</head> in dimerization and in DNA - binding assays ( Fig 3 c ) , but efficiently enhances transactivation by Max - VP16 ( Fig. 2 b ) . This shows that Myc  N can dimerize with Max - VP16 and bind DNA but does not transactivate .  The Myc transactivation domain also functions in yeast when fused to heterologous DNA - binding domains  ( LexA - Myc  ( ref .  22 )  and 1235Myc - SRF ,  data not shown )  .

Bacteria adapt to the lethal effects of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide by inducing the expression of protective stress genes .  Analogous responses have been identified in human cells .  For example , haem oxygenase is a major stress protein in human cells treated with oxidants , and reactive oxygen intermediates <head>activate</head> NF - B , a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in inflammatory and acute - phase responses . We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel complementary DNA  ( CL100 )  corresponding to a messenger RNA that is highly inducible by oxidative stress and heat shock in human skin cells .  The cDNA contains an open reading frame specifying a protein of M  r  39.3K with the structural features of a non - receptor - type protein - tyrosine phosphatase and which has significant amino - acid sequence similarity to a Tyr/Ser - protein phosphatase encoded by the late gene H1  of vaccinia virus .

If we assume that the relative risk is well approximated by the odds ratio ,  the percentage of cases that could be attributable to this genotype was 8 %  in the whole population and 35 %  in the low - risk group .  The values of these estimates indicate a strong impact of the ACE/ID  polymorphism on myocardial infarction in the population .  ACE exists predominantly as an ectoenzyme of vascular endothelial cells and plays a key part in the renin - angiotensin and kallikrein - kinin systems by <head>activating</head> angiotensin I into angiotensin II and inactivating bradykinin . These two peptide hormones have opposite effects on vascular tone and on smooth muscle cell proliferation ,  and as neointimal proliferation and vasospasm may be involved in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease ,  the most likely mechanism by which the ACE polymorphism affects the risk of myocardial infarction is by modulating the level of these peptides in the coronary arteries .  This hypothesis is compatible with earlier results and with a study of hypertensive patients with high renin profiles ,  a condition likely to be associated with increased angiotensin II ,  who were found to be at higher risk of coronary heart disease than those with low renin profiles .

In our system ,  we upset the pattern of tension in the epidermis by cutting so as to create a free epidermal edge .  This abolishes the component of tension acting at right angles to the cut ,  while the tangential tension remains ,  suppressing lamellipodia and provoking formation of an actin cable ,  which in turn presumably reinforces the tangential tension .  The act of wounding may also trigger an influx of Ca 2+ , <head>activating</head> contraction of the cable ; and we have in fact shown elsewhere that c - fos is rapidly induced in the epidermis at a wound margin in rat embryos . We do not know how this activated state is subsequently maintained throughout the healing process ,  although the final overrun and pile - up suggest that it takes some time to switch off .  One attractive hypothesis would be that there is positive feedback ,  whereby tension in the cable generates an intracellular chemi -  cal signal for the maintenance of tension ;  this would maintain an activated state in every cell containing a segment of the taut cable .

An unidentified PLC in soluble fractions of cultured human HL - 60 granulocytes is specifically stimulated by G protein   subunits purified from retina and brain .  Identification of a second PLC -    complementary DNA  ( PLC -  2 )   in an HL - 60 cell cDNA library prompted us to investigate the effect of purified G protein   subunits on the activities of PLC -  1  and PLC -  2  transiently expressed in cultured mammalian cells .

Here we use gene targeting to introduce a mutation in the TCR   or   genes into the germ line of mice .  Initial analysis of these mice revealed that TCR -    gene rearrangement or expression is necessary for the maintenance of normal thymocyte number and the DN to DP transition .  Our results show that a single rearranged TCR - gene introduced as a transgene can quantitatively convert DN cells to DP cells from DN cells that have accumulated in mice mutant for the recombination <head>activating</head> gene - 1 ( RAG - 1 ) and increase the total thymocyte number to the normal level . By contrast ,  TCR -    gene expression seems to be irrelevant for these developmental events .  Our study also indicates that   T cells are unnecessary for the generation of apparently normal    T cells .

Molday PHOTOBLEACHING of rhodopsin in rod photoreceptors <head>activates</head> the visual cascade system leading to a decrease in cyclic GMP and the closure of cGMP - gated channels in the rod outer segment plasma membrane . Calcium plays an important role in the recovery of the rod outer segment to its dark state by regulating the resynthesis of cGMP by guanylate cyclase .  Here we report that calmodulin ,  a Ca 2+   - binding protein present in the rod outer segment ,  increases the apparent Michaelis constant of the channel for cGMP .

Because the channel is in its low - affinity state ,  it may be positioned on the cGMP dose - response curve to be sensitive to a small decrease in free cGMP concentration ,  thus facilitating its closure .  A decrease in cytoplasmic Ca 2+  levels  ( estimated to be below 100nM )  will result because of the decreased influx of Ca 2+  through the channel .  This decrease in Ca 2+ will <head>activate</head> the guanylate cyclase , possibly through recoverin and limit phosphodiesterase activation . Calmodulin will also dissociate from the channel complex and cause the channel to switch to its high - affinity state for cGMP .  The channel will now reopen at a lower cGMP level ,  thus aiding the recovery of the ROS to its dark level as cGMP synthesis proceeds .

There is controversy over whether the carrier also transports a proton  ( or pH - changing anion )  .  Here we show that the carrier generates an alkalinization outside and an acidification inside glial cells ,  and transports anions out of the cells ,  suggesting that there is a carrier cycle in which two Na +  accompany each glutamate anion into the cell ,  while one K +  and one OH  -    ( or HCO )  are transported out .  This stoichiometry predicts a minimum Glu o of 0.6M normally ( tonically <head>activating</head> presynaptic autoreceptors and postsynaptic NMDA receptors ) , and 370M during brain anoxia ( high enough to kill neurons ) . Transport of OH  -   /HCO on the uptake carrier generates significant pH changes ,  and may provide a mechanism for neuron - glial interaction .  Glutamate uptake was monitored electrically in salamander retinal glia ,  which have uptake like that in mammalian glia and neurons but have no glutamate - gated ion channels .

Long - term potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is the primary experimental model for investigating the synaptic basis of learning and memory in vertebrates .  The best understood form of long - term potentiation is induced by the activation of the  receptor complex .  This subtype of glutamate receptor endows long - term potentiation with Hebbian characteristics , and allows electrical events at the postsynaptic membrane to be transduced into chemical signals which , in turn , are thought to <head>activate</head> both pre - and postsynaptic mechanisms to generate a persistent increase in synaptic strength . THE assumption that information is stored in the brain as changes in synaptic efficiency emerged about a century ago following the demonstration by Cajal that networks of neurons are not in cytoplasmic continuity but communicate with each other at the specialized junctions which Sherrington called synapses .  External events are represented in the brain as spatio - temporal patterns of neural activity ,  and it is these patterns of activity which must themselves be the agents of synaptic change .

When many fibres are activated in synchrony by a strong stimulus ,  depolarization spreads between neighbouring synapses to enhance the unblocking of NMDA channels .  Associativity has a similar explanation except that the required depolarization is provided by a different set of afferent fibres ;  in theory ,  these helper inputs could use any neurotransmitter that promotes depolarization ,  and ,  experimentally ,  depolarization is often provided by injecting current into the cell .  Input - specificity is explained by the need for the presynaptic terminal to provide a sufficient concentration of L - glutamate to <head>activate</head> adequate numbers of NMDA receptors . ( It follows that there can be little activation of NMDA receptors by ambient or spontaneously released L - glutamate ,  otherwise LTP would be induced by depolarization alone .  )  Because the induction of LTP by tetanic stimulation is prevented by a variety of NMDA antagonists ,  including those which act at the receptor  ( such as 2 - amino - 5 - phosphonopentanoate  ( AP5 )  )  ,  in the channel  ( for example ,  MK - 801  ( ref .  25 )  )  and at the allosteric glycine site  ( for example ,  7 - chlorokynurenic acid )  ,  it is clear that activation of these receptors is an essential trigger for the process .

There is general agreement that PKC inhibitors will block LTP if they are applied after the tetanus ,  indicating that kinase activity outlasts the initial induction signal .  But the duration of the time - window during which kinase inhibitors are effective and the manner in which the activation of kinases is maintained are both matters of debate .  For example , it has been suggested that constitutively <head>activated</head> PKC is involved because H - 7 , which inhibits the activity of the catalytic subunit , but not sphingosine , which prevents the initial activation of PKC , can depotentiate synapses in a reversible manner even when applied up to 3h after induction . But the selectivity of H - 7 for potentiated pathways has been challenged ,  and other PKC inhibitors that act on the catalytic subunit ,  including K - 252b  ( ref .  85 )  ,  are not able to depotentiate fully established LTP .  There is also disagreement as to whether the sustained kinase activity that might be necessary for LTP is located within the postsynaptic cell or not.

The effect is small ,  develops gradually ,  is blocked by Ca 2+  channel antagonists ,  and requires stronger tetanic stimulation for its induction than is needed for NMDA receptor - dependent LTP .  Long - lasting potentiation can also be induced by transient exposure of hippocampal synapses to a variety of chemical agents ,  including Ca 2+166  ,  arachidonic acid ,  the metabotropic glutamate receptor  ( mGluR )  agonist aminocyclopentane - 1S,3R - dicarboxylate  ( 1S,3R - ACPD )  ,  the K +  channel blocker ,  tetraethylammonium  ( TEA )  and the G - protein activator NaF/AlCl 3  .  Chemically - induced potentiation usually occludes with tetanically - induced LTP ( that is , saturation of one prevents induction of the other ) , suggesting a convergence of mechanisms ; in general , chemically induced LTP is not blocked by NMDA antagonists , presumably because the components of the LTP cascade <head>activated</head> by the various agents lie downstream from the NMDA receptor . BOX 2 The role of amino - acid receptors in the induction of LTP This e.p.s.p .  can be blocked by the quinoxalinedione antagonists ,  such as 6 - cyano - 7 - nitroquinoxaline - 2,3 - dione  ( CNQX )  ,  and is usually referred to as AMPA receptor - mediated after the selective ligand for these receptors  -   amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionate  ( AMPA )  .

Between 9.09.5d.p.c .  ,  these patterns becomes refined with a progressive restriction leading to the appearance of stripes of expression in r2 and r4 and a stream of crest cells migrating from each  ( Fig. 1 i '  )  .  These dynamic changes in spatial expression are identical to those observed with Hox - B1  ,  therefore the combination of Hox  genes expressed in r4  ( ref .  10 )  is reproduced in r2 upon exposure to retinoic acid .  The Hox - B1 experiments showed that a marker for r5 ( expression in neural cell bodies ) was <head>activated</head> in r3 and we wanted to examine whether there were other changes to segmental expression in r3 . We have used a line of transgenic mice that accurately reveals the normal spatial and temporal patterns of Krox - 20  expression in r3 and r5  ( Fig. 3a - e  ;  ref .  23 )  .  In initial stages ,  as reported for both Xenopus  and mouse embryos treated with retinoic acid ,  we find that although there is a clearly defined segment in the r3 position ,  the r3 stripe of Krox - 20  expression is absent .

But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed ,  with clergy being left behind in some areas ,  the clerics remain the true cognoscenti  in religious matters ,  and are expected to be so by the laity .  This has always <head>added</head> to the clergy 's spiritual authority and status , and has tended to merge with the authority claimed by the clergy in matters of faith and morals , with the high clergy deciding what constitutes matters of faith and morals . The attitude towards authority within the church partnered the perception of the spiritual life .

Despite Buckley 's  reluctance to play up the siege of Derry as a key myth and his preference for general categories of interpretation derived from various historical experiences ,  it does seem that the siege has particular significance .

One should <head>add</head> that Buckley takes the Christian myth for granted , as backdrop to the discourse . But one must remember that the divergent reading of the Christian myth by Reformation and Counter - Reformation is at the heart of the religious as opposed to the rough interpretation of the conflict .  The importance of the protestant variant should not be underestimated given the extent of religious practice and the power of religious men within the protestant  loyalist bloc and the grave importance of conceiving of one 's  position as absolutely irreproachable ,  depending as it does on a divine source .

Yeast is made up of millions of tiny fungus cells which literally go berserk when confronted by a liquid rich with sugars .  Within a few hours a scum appears on top of the wort and this rapidly builds up into a great yellowy - brown crust as the yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide .

Finings ,  a glutinous substance made from the bladder of the sturgeon ,  is added either at the conditioning stage or when the beer is in cask to fine or clear the beer .

Instead of a secondary fermentation in the cask to <head>add</head> a full , mature palate , keg beers are killed off in the brewery by a number of unnatural processes that affect the taste and quality of the product .

It seems most surprising that the breweries consider the large open space to be the pub 's  ideal internal form ,  or believe the artificial ,  standardised historic pub interior to be preferable to genuine historic detail ,  when the original internal divisions and features are essential elements of the historic character that customers expect when entering such a building .   The Duke 's  Arms at Presteigne in Powys provides the perfect illustration of how the misguided quest for the ideal traditional pub character can seriously threaten genuine historic features .  This pub was originally a 17th century timber frame jettied building ; in the early 19th century its front was removed and a new rendered facade <head>added</head> . Although the loss of the original front is regrettable ,  the present facade is in accord with the general architectural character of the street and retains original late - Georgian features ,  such as its sashes with glazing bars .  The pub 's  owner ,  however ,  wished to remove the 19th century facade and undertake a conjectural restoration of the jetted ,  timber framed front  ( the design of which included various historically inaccurate details )  .

Richard Jarram ,  senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in London ,  explained that the changes were designed to help India reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund  ( IMF )  .  The IMF will not lend any money unless India shows it is doing something about putting its house in order ,  he explained .  He <head>added</head> that the government was also helping local businesses to expand and invest by cutting down on red tape : If people in business try to expand it is very , very bureaucratic and government approval is needed for most projects . The loosening - up of regulations could lead to more hotels being developed in India .  Hilton International chairman and chief executive Michael Hirst said the country was a target area for the group .

PUBLIC COMPLAINT WAS UNFAIR EVERYONE is entitled to their opinion ,  and while I agree with Joe Hyam 's  concerning service charges  (  Caterer  ,  1521 August )  ,  I feel he is taking unfair advantage of his position to have a go at people who do not do things the Joe Hyam way .  If the restaurant in question <head>adds</head> a service charge , then that is between it and the customer . Complaining in print about one restaurant 's  service charge policy  giving both the restaurant and proprietor 's  name  could cost that establishment a great deal of money in bad publicity .  Mr Hyam can choose not to pay the service charge or pay it under duress ,  stating so ,  but to complain like this in a magazine read by thousands is unfair and childish .

This can be allowed for by the winch or car driver reducing the power slightly .  However ,  this increase in speed must not be relied on if the launch is too slow and the pilot wants more speed ,  because the cause of a slow launch may be the beginning of a power failure ,  in which case steepening up in the hope of creating more speed would be dangerous .  During a winch launch the potential load on the glider is at a maximum near the top of the launch , when the pull of the cable <head>adds</head> directly to the weight of the glider . Excessive speed at this time can be dangerous in rough air if the pilot is pulling back hard .  The take - off

This kind of accident is relatively common with inexperienced pilots ,  especially when they are flying in competitions .  The final glide back to the base airfield at the end of the day is a particularly stressful time .  Usually it is at the end of a long day 's racing , with a number of stressful periods all <head>adding</head> to the pilot 's fatigue . Perhaps the glider is theoretically just within range for a straight glide home ,  but has very little extra height in hand and not much prospect of getting another climb .  At 1,000 feet the pilot may be some distance from his base when some extra height is lost because of strong sink .

The city is divided geographically from mainland Canada .  But the geographical differences pale when they are compared to the deep  threefold divisions which rend the city itself :  of language   ( four - fifths of the population speak French ,  only one fifth English and the smaller languages )  ;  of culture   ( the French - speaking part naturally looks to France and French literature for its mores ,  while the English - speaking part relies on the attachment to the Commonwealth and its close neighbour ,  the United States of America )  ;  and of religion   ( for the gulfs here are wider than the Atlantic as the former protestant cross - sectioning of Episcopalianism/Presbyterianism meets the Roman Catholicism of the French ,  and both meet the surging secularism and agnosticism of our day )  .  To all this is <head>added</head> ( and it must be emphasised that Catholicism has always been in the ascendancy ) , a healthy input from the Jewish fraternity whose civic and educational emphasis greatly increases the town 's well - being , albeit from a proportionately tiny community . ( Professor Dudek has demonstrated that from a base of only 1.7 per cent of the population ,  the input in terms of literature and art amounts to a staggering 25 per cent .  )  Montreal is an unusual city ,  made up of 50 villages which have grown and merged together over the years to form the modern conurbation :  about 100 square kilometres in size  ( 60 square miles )  ,  encircled by the St. Lawrence River .

Mythological or not ,  it has to be emphasised that he was speaking here of a group of poets  Ellenborgen ,  Hine ,  Mandel ,  Purdy ,  Macpherson ,  Layton and Cohen  not just Leonard himself .  But he clearly places Leonard within this group which ,  he held ,  grasps at a confusion of symbolic images ,  often a ragbag of classical mythology ,  in the effort to organise a chaos too large for them to deal with in the light of reason ,  which in turn causes them to express a sardonic bitterness in their social criticism ,  a realism without any utopian idealism to support it .  Not only sardonic bitterness , we must <head>add</head> but delicate irony , too . Leonard 's  mind was such that he always had several ironies in his fire at any one time ,  even when he was seeking to demythologise some of them !

Scobie is surely right when ,  with regard to Let Us Compare Mythologies  he says that the title seems to indicate that Cohen himself regarded the religious sense as the primary one  which in The Spice - Box Of Earth  becomes completely explicit and even urgent .  The ceremony of the havdalah  ,  the bidding adieu to the Sabbath ,  centres on the spice - box and the candle .  The blessing itself is made over a cup of wine in honour of the day ( Blessed art Thou , O Lord our God , King of the universe , who createst divers kinds of spices ) which <head>adds</head> to the light of the Sabbath , symbolised by the candle , offering a fragrance and a beauty all its own . Leonard extends this sense here in this book  to those who will read and ponder .  The book was offered with a sharp recollection of his own family ,  not only regarding his  father 's  absence of many years  ( whose duty it was ,  formally ,  to say the prayer )  ,  but in the dedication of the book ,  another link with the past broken ,  another mainstay ,  albeit distant ,  removed :  This book is dedicated to the memory of my grandmother Mrs Lyon Cohen ,  and to the memory of my grandfather Rabbi Solomon Klinitsky .

It means that we can think about things that are not present .  Sure enough ,  we would expect the input systems to ensure that the right kinds of distinctions are drawn  between contour changes that define occlusion and those which define disappearance ,  for example  but this surely does not mean that the possessor of these input systems is capable of thinking about unperceived entities .  What this <head>adds</head> up to , then , is the claim that if there existed an organism which either could not act or whose actions made no difference to its perceptions then not only would that organism not be cognisant , it could never become cognisant . ( It is not clear to me whether this is some kind of philosophical claim or an hypothesis .  You may say that it is refutable  and so it is empirical ;  but then  see below  our criteria for cognisance are so much bound up with what the subject can do that it is difficult to see how we could assess the cognisance of a totally passive creature .  )

Initially ,  an entry in a reading lexicon which matches the sequence of letters that one has detected is located .

This whole - word visual representation is then used to address and so locate its associated pronunciation in a lexicon of spoken word forms known as the speech output lexicon .

But by 1985 the sad reality had to be faced that  so far as InterCity was concerned  the market had changed ,  probably for ever .

To offset the loss of Glasgow business , extra stops were <head>added</head> to the daytime service which was revamped to serve towns such as Warrington , Wigan , Lancaster , Oxenholme and Penrith which offered greater business prospects . Only the Royal Scot  remained as a viable Euston - Glasgow train but with a schedule fifteen minutes slower than the five - hour norm established in the 1974 timetable .  At one stage the average time of the five daytime trains between Euston and Glasgow was over five and a half hours .

Indeed ,  for a time it enabled the service to become an all HST operation so that some places actually had a better service .  There were four major East Coast developments in the 1980s :  the significant increase in HST productivity so that sets could be more extensively deployed to provide service to Inverness ,  Glasgow Queen Street ,  Hull and Cleethorpes ;  electrification of the route from Hitchin to Leeds with only minor interference to train services ;  introduction of a new track - maintenance strategy and transfer of overnight Anglo - Scottish sleeping - car services to the West Coast main line .  Although the original HST plans provided for two daily return journeys between King 's Cross and Aberdeen , by judicious programming of the sets ( plus some extra sets transferred from the Western region ) it was possible to <head>add</head> on some extra trips to existing rosters . This enabled InterCity to introduce additional HSTs to Aberdeen ,  a pair of business services to Hull and Cleethorpes and an entirely new service The Highland Chieftain  between King 's  Cross and Inverness with a journey time of seven hours .  Because of the need to refuel the two power cars ,  the practical operating range of an HST set is about 1,100 miles after which the unit must visit the depot to replenish its tanks .

Steam - heated hauled stock was also eradicated ,  and the response was the reclassification of more Class 31/4s and 47/4s ,  plus the first Class 37/4s .  Longer - term planning forced BR to embark upon life - extension programmes for several locomotive types expected to be needed until well into the 1990s ,  although they were halted in 1989 before being completed .  English Electric Class 37s in particular were subjected to near - total rebuilds , involving replacement of the main generator with an alternator , regeared CP7 bogies , and in some cases Ruston or Mirrlees power unit , electric - heat generator , or ballast weights <head>added</head> to provide extra adhesion for particular freight work . Thus ,  one standard locomotive design evolved into six specialist types .

It is not easy to achieve this effect if they do not take into account the dimension and spacing of the steps as well as their particular quality ,  which must be in tune with the music if it is to make sense .  A contradiction in style during this change of aulement  or alignment can distort the design .  Nevertheless an unusual change of aulement or alignment can <head>add</head> interest and draw attention to a dancer 's statement . for example :  the swift change from the grand dvelopp   la seconde  which Odile makes facing the audience and her sudden turn to arabesque  when she looks straight into the kneeling Siegfried 's  eyes in the Act II pas de deux of Swan Lake  ;  it is Odile 's  triumph for she knows she has won Siegfried 's  heart .

A sudden change of aulement  ,  an unusual turn in - out of legs or arms ,  or quick jumps up and then down to the floor followed by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement has in the whole design .  Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton 's  five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros  and Consort Lessons  .  In fact such unusual movements often arouse the audience to gentle laughter as swift changes <head>add</head> a touch of humour as two or more dancers compete to capture the attention of both the audience and their Colleagues .

The most outstanding are Scottish ,  Italian and Spanish .  Scottish style  The Royal Danish Ballet 's  production of La Sylphide  is evidence of Bournonville 's  imaginative use of the Scot 's  quick light footwork and capers as well as the very distinctive Highland ports de bras  ,  which help the dancer to sustain balance .  To these features he <head>added</head> purely classical batterie , grands jets en avant and en attitude , cabrioles and quick glissades into chapps la seconde and swift changes of aulement . He also took care to make the patterns of his dances as interesting as in Scottish country dance .  Another example of this stereotyped Scottish style is danced by Swanhilda in Coppiia  .

Although some modern dancers do without music in the accepted sense of that term ,  they rarely do without rhythmic phrasing .  If they do they have forgotten that ,  like them ,  every member of their audience has an inborn sense of measuring time .  .  .

It is thoroughly mixed in a large vessel called a mash tun with hot pure water .  The sugars dissolve into the water and the sweet liquid ,  called wort ,  is pumped to a copper .  The flowers of the hop plant <head>add</head> bitterness to beer and the oils in the plant also guard against any infections during the brewing process . As the wort is boiled in the copper with the hops many brewers also add sugars ,  such as glucose or cereal syrup ,  to encourage a strong fermentation .  CAMRA would prefer beer to be brewed solely from barley malt but the use of sugar dates back to the 19th century and many renowned beers ,  such as Marston 's  Pedigree ,  have recipes that include 10 per cent or more brewing sugars .

Enriched hop powder pellets are also possible by sieving the powder at  35C to remove coarser non a  acid material and by blending with liquid extracts to further enhance the a  acid content .  Pellets may also be stabilised by the inclusion of vitamin C  ( ascorbic acid )  to reduce oxidation .  Calcium and magnesium salts may then be <head>added</head> to partly catalyse conversion of a acids so pre - empting the boiling reactions . Losses of a  acid may be reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent by these means .  Even greater efficiency of a  acid utilisation is obtained using chemical extracts of hops .

Moreover the extraction leaves undesirable chemicals such as pesticides behind .  Carbon dioxide also offers the flexibility to separate the hop components into bitter and flavour fractions .  This advantage is considerable since the bitter fraction may then be chemically manipulated to produce bitter iso a acids from the a acids and so provide a PIKE product which may be <head>added</head> towards the end of the boil or even afterwards . Near 100 per cent utilisation of the hop a  acid is possible by this process .  Flavours may also be separated in the hop extract and can be fractionated .

Dry hop flavour is an interesting application since the use of a liquid extract allows a more accurate and consistent flavour to be produced .  Moreover whole hops used for dry hopping take seven to 10 days for the character to be extracted and then slowly decline .  Dry hop extract provides immediate character which lasts longer and reduces the possibility of infection being <head>added</head> from whole hops or , more likely , from a dirty hand . Because of the degree of processing involved ,  hop extracts are not necessarily cheaper than using whole hops .  Per unit of bitterness they are roughly as costly .

There is no such decline with extracts .  Within 30 years the brewing industry has gone from a cottage industry to high tech .  English Hops began their development of hop oils by looking at the dry hopping end of the brewing process , when a handful of whole or pellet hops are <head>added</head> to casks of beer . There can be problems of infection at this stage ,  David Gardner said .  With hop oils you can get the best from the hops ,  the essential oils and essences that can replicate the aroma and bitterness of two such disparate varieties as a Fuggle and a Golding .

Do not worry that the first solution will actually make the wood darker .  It is applied to turn the wood into an alkaline condition ,  so that when the B or No. 2 solution is applied ,  it will liberate oxygen ,  thus bleaching the wood .

Corrosion in central heating systems is a major problem and can result in a build - up of sludge ,  the main symptom of which is cold areas at the bottom of the radiators .

The result is a townscape of terrible despairing cries which mean ,  and mean more than ,  that the drunks are leaving the pubs between two and three o'clock in the morning ,  the pubs that reek of alcohol and cucumber and fish .  A townscape of nightmare yellows :  sky ,  buildings ,  furniture ,  wallpaper ,  faces  the colour of age ,  heat ,  pestilence ,  bile and jaundice ,  bruisings and stainings ,  with a stronger connotation of dirt in Russian than in English ;  the colour of the tickets of identification which prostitutes were required to carry ;  the colour of Raskolnikov 's  cubbyhole of a room ;  and the colour which greets him when he comes to after fainting at the police station and sees a man holding a yellow glass filled with yellow water .  Looking over Dostoevsky 's shoulder , we find him first writing small yellow glass , then deleting small ; and writing water then <head>adding</head> yellow warm to the water , then deleting warm the final text uniting an apocalyptic starkness of yellow meets yellow with the topicality of Petersburg 's notoriously filthy water supply , a subject of much comment and complaint in the newspapers . At such moments we come  as close as it is possible to get to the spirit of Crime and Punishment  .  Having ,  as I say ,  abandoned everything he had done ,  he sat down and wrote a six - part novel within a year which included a twenty - six day break in which he threw together and dictated The Gambler  ,  itself not a small book nor a negligible one ,  to satisfy the terms of a contract he had made with a shyster publisher .

And , he <head>adds</head> , I have found them . This has the same free ,  metaphysical bearing on his being a drunkard that Raskolnikov 's  wanting to dare has on his being a murderer .

If we take wanting everybody to look at him as the real reason ,  then the case of Stavrogin is  ( in the lawyer 's  phrase )  on all fours with that of the underground man 's  indecent exposure of consciousness .  However ,  I invite nobody into my soul he declares ,  as if to banish the exhibitionist thought.44 And then if the search for suffering is allowed to eclipse the rest ,  we are back with Marmeladov squinnying into the bottom of his vodka jug ;  whereas Stavrogin saying he wants to forgive himself might be Raskolnikov pondering retrospectively ,  selfcritically ,  on his admission of guilt at the police station .

Laser beams consist of photons which ,  though small by atomic standards ,  have a cumulative inertial effect ,  Dr Carl Wieman of the University of Colorado ,  who heads one research group ,  says that cooling an atom with a laser beam is like trying to slow down movement of a heavy object by bombarding it with ping - pong balls .  In practice it is quite complex because you need at least six lasers to trap a clump of atoms ;  the lasers also have to be tuned to the natural movement of the atoms .  Otherwise the effect is to <head>add</head> heat energy rather than remove it . What Wieman has done  as well as reaching the lowest temperature on record  is to simplify what has been an immensely complex piece of laboratory apparatus .

Traffic message control  ( TMC )  ,  under development as one of the European Drive projects ,  may bring RDS a little nearer to Carfax .  This is seen as using RDS as a data channel of very limited capacity in conjunction with a speech synthesis chip or possibly some form of printer in the car  ( it could provide automatic translation when travelling abroad )  as a means of sending traffic telegrams to cars without interrupting the radio programmes .  But TMC seems bound to <head>add</head> much extra intricacy to the already complicated RDS receiver . D Kopitz  ( EBU )  in discussing  development of TMC admits that :  The TMC device will probably be too complex to permit its incorporation within a standard car radio case .

A key text is his early essay ,  Structure ,  Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences ,  which concludes that there are two possible interpretations of interpretation :  The one seeks to decipher ,  dreams of deciphering a truth or an origin which escapes play and the order of the sign ,  and which lives the necessity of interpretation as an exile .  The other ,  which is no longer turned toward the origin ,  affirms play and tries to pass beyond man and humanism . Derrida says that these two interpretations are absolutely irreconcilable , even though , he <head>adds</head> in his gnomic fashion , we reconcile them in an obscure economy . It is his second interpretation ,  deriving substantially from Nietzsche ,  that has become dominant in deconstruction as popularly understood ,  where all meaning is turned into play .  And it is this approach which leads to denunciation of Derrida as a  nihilist ;  in Frederick Crews 's  words ,  an intellectual nihilist ,  though a learned and exuberant one .

The publicity his ideas have attracted has only deepened the tragedy : the bad influence of those he has himself influenced has <head>added</head> frivolity to the obscurity Derrida 's  admirers ,  and perhaps some disinterested observers ,  would reject such charges as based on misunderstandings of his work .

To identify English as peculiarly problematical should not weaken the general defence of humane values in education ,  and may in the longer run help to strengthen them .  A successful military campaign may require giving up some  tactically untenable territory .

In the wake of the MacCabe affair in 1981 ,  an editorial in the Times Higher Education Supplement  said that a fissiparous discipline such as English had a number of hard choices in front of it :  it could become even more pluralistic and diffuse ,  with accompanying pedagogic problems ;  it could repressively impose one favoured approach ;  or it could split .  Raymond Williams came to think that a splitting of the discipline was increasingly likely ,  since cultural materialism and radical semiotics were not compatible with the dominant paradigm of literary study :  For these necessarily include the paradigm itself as a matter for analysis ,  rather than as a governing definition of the object of knowledge .

The poem ,  we might say ,  is in two minds about itself and its own meaning .   But that is not the whole story .

Moreover in some important respects Pound was more old - fashioned than Eliot .  As his later disastrous interventions in politics would make clear ,  he was a realist in quite a simple - minded sense ,  one who was concerned for public life ,  and believed  ( like activists of the Left )  that a poet had the right and the duty to act in and upon that life quite directly ;  whereas the oddly distant weariness of Eliot 's  political pronouncements ,  even when he was most engag  as editor of True Criterion  ,  revealed a man for whom the psychological reality of private torments took priority over any reality which announced itself as social and public .

Mr Howell <head>added</head> : No advice was obtained about the legality of the deals . That lack of authorisation by councillors was one of the four grounds on which the auditor was trying to prove the transactions were unlawful .

The company said that the first six months of the year have seen more new business than during any previous period .

British Aerospace <head>added</head> to the speculation by refusing officially to confirm or deny the story . However ,  well - informed sources ruled out both British Aerospace and STC as buyers ,  saying they believed Hoare Govett was acting on behalf of normal investment clients or Middle Eastern investors with an interest in Ferranti 's  future .  Stock market sources said that the Hoare Govett buying dried up after about 60 million Ferranti shares had been traded ,  at which point Smith New Court stepped in and remained an aggressive buyer at 56p until the close .

THE DOMINANT BELIEFS OF THE TWO ALLIANCES As we examine the dominant beliefs of the two alliances ,  it must be stressed that we are not looking at beliefs possessed by each and every person who identifies to a greater or lesser extent with either set of traditions .  Rather we are looking at those beliefs , supported by significant power bases within each bloc , which have <head>won</head> out in the political process in the past seventy years and still appear to be doing so , in some cases with much decreased vitality . The dominant beliefs of the catholic  nationalist bloc still are that the group forms a people who are Gaelic - Irish ,  constitute a nation ,  are republican ,  and populate an island which has a natural ,  inner political unity .  We reiterate :  the dominant beliefs of the alliances which we have termed historical blocs are not necessarily shared by all but are promoted successfully by dominant groups and have some grounding in the consciousness of the wider membership .

The way the police sustain this ideology of action to maintain their hegemony becomes clearly apparent to the researcher ,  and he in turn stands revealed .

The predominance these spatial constructs have for the ordinary constable is essential to an understanding of the police mind .  Ideas of centrality and marginality of place link to the status of activities and tie in with perceptions of derogatory and despised areas of operation .  As a result , actual and symbolic transitions across spatial boundaries continue to create a crucial means of analysing the way police reality deals with the changes in power politics at all levels within the institution , and of describing the way status can be <head>won</head> or lost . The structural load which exists within seemingly minor career moves or internal transfers around the force is enormous .  Everyone inside knows or speculates endlessly on the politics of power implicit in the most minute gradations of change .

Referees seem incapable of deciding whether a fast ,  controlled snap punch to the face has scored or not ,  and they generally disallow them .

Of course , a punch inevitably strikes home and , instead of <head>winning</head> a point , a penalty is incurred .

That is to say ,  they behave like three - year - olds on false belief tasks even if their mental ages are ,  by other criteria ,  well above three years .  This is not  the case in non -   autistic mentally handicapped children ,  who do well on false belief tasks so long as their mental age ,  by other criteria ,  is above three years .  We also tested a sample of autistic children in the chocolate - finding task and found that they were again behaving just like the three - year - olds : going to the baited box for twenty trials , despite wanting to <head>win</head> chocolates and occasionally trying to filch them from the experimenter 's bag . This suggests the hypothesis that one of the features of autism is a lack of central control of thinking similar to that found in very young normal children .  Their input systems function adequately ,  but their thinking lacks the full ,  holistic character of normal thought .

Coda We have covered a lot of ground ,  and maybe the path through the undergrowth of arguments and data is not a very straight or a very clear one .  I certainly would not want to attempt a summary of the route we have taken all the way from the mind - body problem to children trying to <head>win</head> chocolates ; but I do need to make some concluding comments to justify the bold claim in the first paragraph that constructivism makes the mind - body problem less intractable . I argued that the representational theory of mind ,  with its assumption that thinking is the possession of determinate mental states which are in some sense encodings  ( pictorial ,  syntactic )  of actual or possible states of affairs ,  contributes to the difficulty of the mind - body problem .  We have mainly been concerned with the modern computational version of the representational theory of mind ;  but ,  as I shall mention again later ,  the more traditional views of mental life are no less representational  phenomenology ,  for example ,  is a representational theory of mind .

It 's  the titles that matter ,  and Martina ,  with 156 ,  has her fair share of them .  In fact ,  by winning the Pilkington Glass Ladies '  title in June for the 10th time ,  she came to within one of Chris Evert 's  record of 157 career titles .  This latest victory at the sunswept and showery Eastbourne was probably one of her most satisfying , not least because she defeated a player in the final who herself , did everything but <head>win</head> . Arantxa Sanchez - Vicario positively demolished her opponents with a ruthlessness reminiscent of Navratilova 's  great rival of the 1980 's  ,  Chris Evert .

A contradiction in style during this change of aulement  or alignment can distort the design .  Nevertheless an unusual change of aulement  or alignment can add interest and draw attention to a dancer 's  statement .  for example : the swift change from the grand dvelopp la seconde which Odile makes facing the audience and her sudden turn to arabesque when she looks straight into the kneeling Siegfried 's eyes in the Act II pas de deux of Swan Lake ; it is Odile 's triumph for she knows she has <head>won</head> Siegfried 's heart . Even more exciting changes of aulement  can be found in Ashton 's  Birthday  Offering  where each soloist dances an old step at a new angle ,  without breaking the rules or older conventions of nineteenth - century ballet .  He then gives an entirely new quality to the class - room exercise on which these enchanements  are based.

Just as the wolf will chase its prey ,  Fido chases his ball .  In the heat of the moment ,  the grey - coated wolf will wrestle with its quarry and Fido will violently shake rags until they lie motionless or chew squeaky toys until they squeak no more .  The pack will pull the carcass apart , competing for the best of the kill , and Fido plays tug - of - war games , hoping to <head>win</head> the toy . Once successful ,  he will run around and not allow you to get hold of his prize .  Not only do dogs play games to exercise their hunting skills ,  they play to determine who is boss .

As the game progresses , owners should start to <head>win</head> the chase or the tug - of - war so , by the end of each game scenario before Fido has lost interest they are in possession of the toy , playing with it and not allowing Fido to have it .

With the death of Tixier - Vignancour a distinctive line of French politicians seems to have come to an end .  It can be traced directly back to the anti - Dreyfusard cause of the late nineteenth century .  Tixier - Vignancour declined to be described as anti - semitic ( he once sued Sam White of the Evening Standard for calling him this ) but he was in no danger of <head>winning</head> a righteous gentile award . His political heirs include Jean Marie Le Pen ,  leader of the Front National and the left - wing advocate Maitre Jacques Verges who attempted to revive the defence of blackmail during the 1987 trial of the SS officer Klaus Barbie .  But neither of them can match the pungency of the original ,  an atmosphere of beaujolais ,  cigars and malevolence ,  and of political or legal plots being brewed in the all - night brasseries of Les Halles .

But several senior finance officers said last week that between two and three dozen health authorities could face bed closures and service cuts in the next couple of months ,  with others deferring developments .  Problems have arisen despite this year 's  cash for the NHS appearing ,  when it was announced last November ,  to allow for real growth for the first time in years ,  even after taking into account inevitable pressures such as the rising number of elderly people .  Since then , however , a whole range of staff from administrative and clerical , to senior managers , anciliaries and technicians have <head>won</head> pay rises above , and sometimes well above , the 5 per cent the NHS was given for inflation . Non - pay items such as drugs and equipment have been running above 7 per cent as inflation generally has risen .

In a speech that blended music - hall style with soap - box rhetoric ,  the veteran left wing MP for Bolsover ,  said :  For too long the Labour Party has been trying to follow in the wake of Mrs Thatcher 's  agenda .  We have to escape from the time warp in which ,  unfortunately ,  some people are still caught after three election defeats in a row .

AFTER four days of sparring ,  Eric Vanderaerden unleashed his Sunday punch to knock out the fading hopes of Sean Kelly ,  and the whole of Ireland ,  in the Nissan Classic ,  which finished in Dublin yesterday after five days and 925km .  The Belgian ,  who had popped out of the clinches to snatch narrow verdicts in three mass sprint finishes ,  settled the race with a remarkable show in the 40km time trial .  Not since 1985 , when he <head>won</head> a Tour de France time trial , had Vanderaerden shown such form against the clock . Not only did he catch a crestfallen Kelly ,  who had started a minute ahead of him ,  but he socked the hopes of Frenchman Charly Mottet and the Swiss powerhouse Thomas Wegmuller .  Vanderaerden averaged more than 46kph to beat Mottet by nine seconds ,  then ,  aided by his Panasonic teammates ,  carefully controlled the afternoon race through the Wicklow mountains .

Kelly finished fourth overall ,  ousted from second place by Mottet and Wegmuller ,  and came close to losing the King of the Mountains honour .  Only on the final climb of Sally Gap did he clinch victory as his rival ,  Gary Baker ,  was struggling back from two punctures .

As if 24 - 17 and derisive chants of Easy ,  easy were not bad enough ,  this humiliation was against a side who have made a wretched start to the season  a week earlier Pontypool had given them a 35 - 6 going - over  and were short of at least half - a - dozen first - choice players .

Roger Fry acknowledged German scholarship as a precursor of serious art historical studies in this century .  Fry was a connoisseur of Renaissance art ,  but also he defended Post - Impressionism  ( a term he invented )  ,  was a painter ,  and published a monograph on Czanne .  In 1933 he <head>wrote</head> as follows in a lecture at Cambridge University : An enormous amount of work has been done and perhaps still more remains to be done in arranging works of art in exact sequence of time .  It is here that the Germans have done so much pioneer work ,  and indeed the whole tendency of their art historical studies has been to regard works of art almost entirely from a chronological point of view ,  as coefficients of a time sequence ,  without reference to their aesthetic significance .

A guide to art reference books published in 1969 had 2,500 entries ,  some of which referred to series ;  for example ,  there was a single entry for the series of monographs on individual artists ,  called Klassiker der Kunst  ,  also published in French as Classiques d'Art  ,  in which there are thirty - eight books .  This guide was extensively revised over nine  years ,  and was republished in 1980 as a Guide to the Literature of Art  History ,  intended for persons doing serious research in the field of art history .  Another sort of writing about art is what artists themselves have <head>written</head> , either about their own work or about other artists . This may be by way of theory ,  or on more matter - of - fact lines about technique or such questions as composition .  Some writing by artists takes the form of instruction ;  in every period manuals on how to do it ,  whether drawing ,  making sculpture or other technical tasks are found ,  though their incidence is irregular ,  and such treatises are often the work of minor artists ,  rather than the great ;  Leonardo is an exception .

The internal politics of Surrealism were complicated by rivalries and ideological disputes ;  in the case of Andr Breton 's  association with Dali ,  his earlier support gave way to a denunciation of the artist ,  who was expelled from the group .  Another famous figure ,  Joan Mir ,  initially praised by Breton as the most Surrealist painter ,  later described his Surrealist phase as having lasted only for a matter of months .  A personal friend of an artist may have a real advantage in <head>writing</head> criticism , as he may learn about artistic intentions which are not explained to others . This places a critic in a privileged position ,  but also with a responsibility to make clear whether views expressed are those of the critic or those of the artist .  This distinction can be limpid if the artist is directly interviewed ,  and the interview is verbatim ;  but there are problems of evidence with filming and tape recordings ,  as well as with interviews ,  since the viewer or reader is unlikely to know how they have been edited .

Such polarities were evidently valuable aids to several generations of Wlflinn 's  pupils who could benefit from his personal teaching as well as the rather more rigid theory in his books .  Wlflinn used such terms to distinguish epochs ;  they are only partly useful as interpretation ,  since Wlflinn tended to be more interested in art as an independent phenomenon than as having meaning intended by the artist .  Wlflinn <head>wrote</head> Renaissance and Baroque in 1888 , which in the preface he described as follows : The subject of this study is the disintegration of the Renaissance .  It is intended to be a contribution to the history of style rather than of individual artists .

Occasionally a book has almost achieved immortality ,  like John Ruskin 's  Stones of Venice  ,  but even more modest books can call up the spirit of a place ;  and a private letter may illuminate both a person and a work of art .  It is easy to sympathise with a traveller who writes :  I have seen a quantity of things here  churches ,  palaces ,  statues ,  fountains and pictures ;  and my brain is at the moment like the portfolio of an architect ,  or a print - shop ,  or a common - place book .  This is from one of the letters <head>written</head> by Shelley in Italy , which goes on to describe the painting of St Cecilia by Raphael : You forget that it is a picture as you look at it There is a unity and perfection in it of an incommunicable kind .

Interpretation of the artist 's  work ,  however ,  depends on the artist 's  own account ,  since Nordenfalk had the deliberate intention of presenting Van Gogh the writer and thinker .  The sober intentions of his book were very different from the novels ,  plays and films which have created a mythical figure in modern culture of the artist as isolated and neglected ,  recognised only after his death ,  and whom the phrase genius and madness are near aligned seems to fit .  The novel Lust for Life by Irving Stone , published in 1934 , is the most famous of these productions , popularising a vein of interpretation established early in the century by some of Van Gogh 's first advocates , such as the taste - maker Julius Meier - Graefe , who defended Van Gogh in 1906 , and went on to <head>write</head> a book in his praise in 1921 called Vincent . But this was a drama ,  the story of the circumstances of Van Gogh 's  life ;  No attempt has  been made ,  wrote Meier - Graefe ,  to make a critical analysis of the pictures ,  which enter upon the scene only in so far as they concern the drama directly or indirectly .

ARTISTS OWN WRITING Van Gogh is famous not only for his art ,  but for his writing .  He did not <head>write</head> an autobiography , but his letters have been a source of fascination to a wide audience , especially artists . Luckily ,  he had a correspondent in his brother Theo in whom he could confide and with whom he could explore ideas about art ;  the letters are thus an invaluable source of interpretation .  From the distance of a century ,  some of Van Gogh 's  enthusiastic appraisals of the art of his time look curious ;  but then ,  this artist acting as a critic was especially vulnerable to admiring art with a moral purpose ,  or work from which he was able to draw inspiration .

What private letters from an artist can do best is to elucidate what was uppermost in an artist 's  mind at the time ,  often artistic aims which would be difficult to discover otherwise .  Besides which ,  there are some artists whom it is a pleasure to know even a little better from their letters .  Many readers must have sighed with regret that so few of Gainsborough 's letters have survived , since the charm of his style is so fresh ; it is easy to sympathise with him <head>writing</head> about his professional commitment to portraiture , on behalf of two fine ladies , his daughters : I 'm sick of Portraits and wish very much to take my viol - da - gamba and walk off to some sweet village ,  where I can paint landskips and enjoy the fag - end of life in quietness and ease .  But these fine ladies and their tea - drinkings ,  husband - huntings ,  etc. ,  etc. ,  etc. ,  will job me out of the last ten years ,  and I fear miss getting husbands too .

Writing on Auguste Rodin can make the point .  According to George Heard Hamilton ,  Rodin became a figure of international significance ,  the most admired ,  prolific ,  and influential sculptor since Bernini .  His secretary , the poet Rainer Maria Rilke , <head>wrote</head> with feeling about his work , but during the 1920s Rodin was less regarded , and not until after the Second World War did his reputation revive under the stimulus of exhibitions and increasingly careful cataloguing of his work . A decline of the sculptor 's  reputation derived not only from the political discredit into which the regimes of the years before 1914 had fallen ,  but also from a distaste for allegory ,  and a revulsion from naturalist sculpture  ( which the young Brancusi expressed forcefully as a dislike for beefsteak )  .  With the rise of modernism ,  Rodin 's  reputation fell ;  with the decline of modernism ,  Rodin 's  fame is growing again .

The interpretation of imagery ,  the circumstances of production ,  the place of the work in the artist 's  career ,  the historical context ,  the precise information about the work 's  appearance and condition ,  these are things that can be fully discussed in a monograph .   VERSATILE ARTISTS A monograph on an artist who practises in several fields can be unusually interesting , since the writer 's brief is to <head>write</head> with equal competence on different topics . Occasionally the challenge is too daunting ,  and teams of writers combine forces rather than one author attempting to rival the knowledge and skills of a Leonardo .  More frequently work in different media is split up into specialist studies ,  so that although there are general studies of Gauguin 's  work ,  there are also specialist monographs on his prints ,  and on his sculpture and ceramics .

EXHIBITION CATALOGUES Exhibitions are major arenas for spectators of art ,  as well as for artists '  struggles to achieve reputations and recognition .  This section will consider not what the critics <head>write</head> in reviews of exhibitions , but the criticism which is contained within the exhibition catalogues ; not the commentary from the box , but the programme of events . A first broad division between types of exhibitions needs to be made .

The subtitle of the show was Women artists move into the mainstream ,  1970  1985 .  The catalogue is 300 pages long with eight essays ,  as well as artists '  biographies .

Stein ( six sections ) and Ann - Sargent Wooster ( four sections on video ) . Such a catalogue inevitably tends to describe and characterise artists rather than evaluate them ,  while interpretation is likely to be left to quotations from the artists .

A dealer will have chosen his critic with special care for an introduction ,  an ideal candidate often being a sympathetic friend ,  perhaps a curator .  In 1904 Sidney Colvin was Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum .  Colvin had known Burne - Jones , and was persuaded to <head>write</head> a preface for a London gallery show . His text preserves a careful balance between deference ,  quotation and his own selective critical comment :  The nature of Burne - Jones 's  aims and predilections in art are well - enough known by this time ,  and have been defined by himself absolutely fitted to this thought :  I mean by a picture a beautiful romantic dream of something that never was ,  never will be  in a light better than any light that ever shone  in a land no one can define or remember ,  only desire .

( a )  references to signatures ,  inscription and dates refer to the present state of the work ;    ( b )  the term bears a signature and/or date and/or inscription means that in our opinion the artist 's  name and/or date and/or inscription have been added by another hand ;   ( c )  the term signed and/or dated and/or inscribed means that in our opinion the signature and/or date and/or inscription are from the hand of the artist .  Such caution is prudent in a business where errors of judgement can be extremely expensive ;  at least the reader of an auction catalogue knows clearly what view has been taken by the cataloguer on a number of questions .  The auction catalogue can also quote from other authorities , which will be inevitable in a case where a scholar has <head>written</head> a catalogue raisonn , and advantageous if the context of the work is made clearer by the artist 's correspondence or other publications . Long catalogue entries recall the cynical remark that the price of a painting is in ratio to the length of the bibliography in the sale catalogue .  Besides seeking to establish the authenticity of works in the sale room ,  auctioneers are also concerned that the title to ownership is secure .

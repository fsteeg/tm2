They were seen to succeed in living a sexually pure life as part of this .  There was some extension of the pietistic ideal .  Sodalities , such as the Legion of Mary , Opus Dei , and Christian Life communities , have partially extended this form of commitment to some , particularly more middle - class laity , and continue to have an important role in <head>activating</head> laity for what are judged to be religious goals both personally and socially . But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed ,  with clergy being left behind in some areas ,  the clerics remain the true cognoscenti  in religious matters ,  and are expected to be so by the laity .

Gilbert refers to a dissertation by Richard Allen Soloway which shows contemporary fears of Christianity falling before the atheistical ,  licentious ,  and immoral foreigner  ( Sexual Deviance and Disaster ,  98 ,  99 ,  1001 ,  11011 )  .  The sodomite becomes a virulent image of this threat ,  embodying a foreign infection which in turn is linked to social disorder and economic collapse at home .  A violent , enduring mythology is <head>activated</head> to make sense of immediate socio - political crisis and fear . This analysis suggests that if ,  in periods of intensified conflict ,  crisis is displaced on to the deviant ,  the process only succeeds because of the paranoid instabilities at the heart of dominant cultural identities .  Further ,  such displacements of non - sexual fears on to the sexual deviant ,  be he or she actual ,  imagined ,  or constituted in and by the displacement ,  are made possible because other kinds of transgression  political ,  religious  are not only loosely associated with the sexual deviant ,  but condensed in the very definition of deviance .

Qaddafi ,  however ,  thinks of nations as permanently active groups in continual session ,  not disappearing from practice when they are not needed .  They are the chief motor of history ,  undermining artificial creations such as states which attempt to impose solidarities on people ,  to claim their lives and property ,  for political or economic or military purposes .

After trying various neurotransmitters the group found that serotonin could potentiate the cell 's  response  ie  enhance the response to stimulation .  The difference between long and short term memory depends on whether certain NMDA  (  N  methyl - D - aspartate )  receptors were activated or not. A stronger ( long ) serotonin stimulus causes the release of amino acids which <head>activate</head> the NMDA receptors , leading to long term memory . A short stimulus gives only a transient NMDA elevation ,  but if the cells are treated with both serotonin and NMDA ,  then long term potentiation could be induced .  The team also found that long term potentiation led to the persistent elevation of cAMP in the cells ,  while short term potentiation was associated with only a transient elevation of cAMP .

The suggestion that pre - exposure to a stimulus establishes an exact representation of it ,  for instance ,  is not in itself enough to explain latent inhibition ;  indeed it seems capable of predicting quite the wrong result .  The ability of the CS to evoke the CR after conditioning trials have been given will depend ,  in part ,  upon that stimulus being identified with the one that was presented during conditioning .  To the extent that this identification is more likely to be made when the stimulus in question is already capable of <head>activating</head> a detailed representation , the likelihood of a vigorous CR may be increased . What we have already seen ,  however ,   ( p. 24 )  is that pre - exposure to the to - be - CS results in retarded  development of the CR .  Clearly ,  this aspect of our account of habituation is not enough in itself to explain the latent inhibition effect .

This is what has been claimed for an alternative associative account put forward by McLaren ,  Kaye ,  and Mackintosh  ( 1989 )  .  This theory develops the convergence  ( also noted by others ,  e.g. Sutton and Barto 1981 ;  Gluck and Bower 1988 )  between standard associative models and connectionist systems of parallel distributed processing  ( e.g. Rumelhart ,  Hinton ,  and McClelland 1986 )  and it is intended to apply to a range of phenomena in perceptual learning .  For our present purposes , however , the important feature of the model is that it develops the implications of the widely accepted notion that even the simplest stimulus will consist of a set ( probably a large number ) of elements and that only some of these will be sampled ( will <head>activate</head> their central representations ) on a given exposure ( cf. Estes 1950 ;  Neimark and Estes 1967 )  .  Latent inhibition is held to be a consequence of the formation of associations among these elements .

All the accounts of latent inhibition discussed so far have assumed that what is learned during pre - exposure interferes with the formation of the CS - US association .  Revusky  ( 1971 )  call his theory a concurrent  interference theory to emphasize just this point and to distinguish it from another commonly held interpretation of proactive interference .  According to this alternative view , the target association may be formed perfectly normally but since , on a subsequent test trial , both this and any previously learned association will become <head>activated</head> when the CS is presented , the subjects may fail to retrieve the correct one and the likelihood of the CR will be reduced . Indeed ,  the effects of retrieval failure may also be evident during the course of conditioning itself because any trial after the first can be viewed as being a test trial on which the subject is required to retrieve information acquired on earlier trials .  Clearly the retrieval - failure hypothesis will make many of the same predictions as other theories of latent inhibition .

One possibility that follows from Wagner 's   ( 1981 )  theory is that the magnitude of the CR might actually be enhanced .  In the context used for training ,  contextual cues will be able to establish an A2 )   ( secondary activation )  representation of the CS thereby limiting the ability of the stimulus itself to evoke Al  ( primary activation )  .  In a different context , however , the CS will be able to evoke Al and since the Al state is better than A2 at <head>activating</head> an associative link , the CS will be better able to elicit its CR when the context is changed . There may be other associative effects ,  however ,  and these allow the possibility that a change of context might reduce the likelihood of the CR .  In particular ,  associations will also be formed between the context and the US ,  allowing the former to come to elicit ,  at least to some degree ,  the CR evoked by the nominal CS .

Thus both A and B could become directly linked with a representation of stimulus X as shown in Fig 5.10 ( a )  .  Subsequent training with A followed by an unconditioned stimulus  ( US )  might allow the formation of an association between the associatively activated representation of X and the US .  Thus B would become capable of activating the US representation ( and of evoking a CR ) by way of its ability to <head>activate</head> the X representation . A and B might well have features in common from the outset  ( the c  elements in the figure )  and these will produce primary generalization  training on A will give associative strength to stimulus elements that are present also in B. The X representation functions in just the same way as the c  elements in producing generalization except for the fact that the ability of A and B to activate X is based on prior conditioning .  It should be acknowledged that not all theories of Pavlovian learning are entirely happy with the suggestion that an associatively activated representation can form an excitatory link with the  ( directly activated )  representation of some other event .

The critical aspect of differentiation theory in this context is its assertion that exposure to A and B will lead to an increase in the number of distinctive features that can be detected .  This must mean ,  in terms of the figure ,  an increase in the number of a  and b  elements activated by the stimuli ,  something that can be represented diagrammatically in more than one way .  Figure 5.11 ( b ) shows an increase in the areas a and b with a consequent reduction in the proportion ( although not the absolute number ) of c elements <head>activated</head> by a stimulus . figure 5.11 ( c )  presents a slightly different possibility in which the sizes of  the A and B circles have not been changed .  There is no net increase in the number of elements activated by a given stimulus but the circles have been moved apart ,  indicating not only an increase in the number of unique elements activated by a stimulus but a corresponding decrease in the number of common elements activated .

Transmitters and mediators The transmitter substances which we described in chapters 4 and 6 provided a valuable basis from which to start searching for new drugs .  Dale and his colleagues in the 1930s showed that acetylcholine , in addition to its other properties , was a local hormone relaying messages at autonomic ganglia , that is at critical points in the nerve pathways which control the heart and blood vessels , and at the sites where nerves <head>activate</head> voluntary muscles . The first drugs which could be relied on to reduce the dangerously high arterial pressure which precedes strokes and heart failure were substances which blocked the actions of acetylcholine at these ganglia ,  and so prevented the passage of nervous messages which put up the blood pressure .  A series of synthetic compounds ,  with a long pedigree going back to the work of Crum Brown and Fraser in the 1860s  ( see chapter 2 )  ,  were produced simultaneously by R. B. Barlow and H. R. Ing in the Pharmacology Laboratory at Oxford and by W. D. M.  ( later Sir William )  Paton and Eleanor Zaimis at the National Institute for Medical Research .

It is highly likely that this agglutinin is fibrinogen  ( Gartner et al ,  1980 ;  Berndt  Phillips ,  1981 )  .

The Ijmuiden Ridge is highlighted as a possible structural influence in a manner analogous to the Dowsing Fault - Zone .  The Ijmuiden Ridge forms the southern edge of the inverted Broad Fourteens Basin and has the characteristics of a line of complex re - <head>activated</head> fault movement . Hercynian influences are largely obscured by the later structural effects ,  but as a result of the improved quality of seismic data ,  some important aspects of pre - Permian structure have been defined .  With the exception of the London - Brabant Massif ,  the structural form is considered to be largely independent of the Mesozoic structure described above .

Recent research in tumour promotion backs up this objection .  Tumour promoters are substances such as the phorbolesters that are n't carcinogenic by themselves but encourage the growth of malignant tumours in cells that have previously been exposed to a low dose of a true carcinogen  ( known as an initiator )  .  Researchers have now discovered that even by themselves , promoters can stimulate cells to produce <head>activated</head> forms of oxygen , known as free radicals . These can damage DNA .  Promoters presumably would fall within Albert 's  nongenotoxic or epigenetic category ,  a daunting prospect to those who favour erring on the side of safety .

Carcinogens awaken sleeping genes CANCER cells are almost by definition cells that have escaped from the controls that govern the behaviour of the individual cells in a multicellular organism .  And recent research has dramatically shown that one way for them to make the break is through the activation of cellular oncogenes genes that are more or less inactive in normal cells hut seem to be altered or <head>activated</head> in tumour cells ( New Scientist , vol 96 , p418 . Now two Americans ,  Vincent Wilson and Peter Jones at the University of Southern California ,  have evidence that one of the actions of cancer - causing chemicals may be to jam the mechanism that normally keeps these genes  as well as other cellular genes  under control .  The mechanism thee were looking at is a chemical modification of the DNA known as methylation .

Hayward and his collaborators are among those to have reported this discovery in ANAS  ( vol 79 ,  p 7842 )  ;  they ,  and a collaborative team led by Bob Gallow of the US National  Institutes  of Health and Carlo Croce of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia ,  have shown that the myc  gene is strategically placed at the breakpoint where the translocated fragment of chromosome 8 links up with chromosome 14 in lymphoma cells .  At the same time ,  Phil Ledler ,  Stuart Aaronson and G. Lenoir have gone further and shown that in Burkitt 's  lymphoma cells the myc  gene becomes linked with DNA - encoding parts of the antibody molecule .  But while these reports neatly confirm Kein 's and Hayward 's ideas about the activation of proto - oncogenes in leukaemias and lymphomas , they have also helped to unleash a surprisingly violent controversy about how the proto - oncogene is <head>activated</head> . Harvard 's  experiments on bird tumours ,  for example ,  showed that viral insertion increased the expression of the myc  gene  and Croce and his collaborators reported that they found increased expression of myc  in Burkin 's  lymphomas  ( Science  ,  vol 21 8 ,  p 983 )  .  But others have failed to find such quantitative increases ,  and suspect instead that in the course of translocation ,  the alene is altered in a way that causes a qualitative change in its product .

SATURATED hydrocarbons  ( alkanes )  such as methane and ethane contain the strongest known carbon - hydrogen bonds ;  bonds that are notoriously difficult to break in a controlled way .  Now chemists have discovered several compounds of transition metals such as tungsten and iridium that can split an alkane carbon - hydrogen bond to form a carbon - metal bond instead .  Once attached to a metal , an alkane is <head>activated</head> : it is easier to convert into other useful organic chemicals . The abundance of alkanes makes them particularly attractive starting materials for industrial processes .  The enormous stocks of methane under the North sea are mainly used for fuel  natural gas .

Bergman used his iridium compound in a sequence of reactions to demonstrate how to convert an alkane into an iodine derivative called an alkyl iodide .  Organic chemists can change alkyl iodides into almost any other products they want .  Although these transition metal compounds will <head>activate</head> carbon - hydrogen bonds , they do not behave catalytically , and so are of limited practical value . A catalyst facilitates a chemical process without being used up or changed itself .  Bergman 's  iridium compound ,  for example ,  is itself chemically altered during the alkyl iodode reaction .

Ch'i  is a universal fluid out of which bodies condense and into which they dissolve .

The concrete meaning of the word in ordinary language is in fact breath ,  and the alternations of breathing out and in are the paradigms for the ch'i  in its active phase moving ,  expanding ,   rarefying  as the Yang ,  and in its passive phase reverting to stillness ,  contracting ,  solidifying ,  as the Yin .

This has been an important influence in promoting a communicative approach to the teaching of languages .  It should be noted ,  however ,  that the rationale for such an approach relates primarily to the ends and not the means of learning ,  and is directed at furthering the cause of cultural co - operation in Europe .  The original concern for out - of - school education is evident in the way objectives are defined in terms of utility . : threshold level specifications are drawn up with an eye to meeting the needs of learners as eventual participants in contexts of communicative interaction , rather than with a concern to <head>activate</head> the actual learning process itself . Their relevance outside the situation for which they were designed ,  where eventual aims  cannot be so readily related to learning objectives ,  should not therefore be taken on trust  ( see Widdowson 1983 )  .  But it has been commonly supposed that specifications along threshold level lines must be universally relevant ,  without reference to the definition of objectives for learning on which the original threshold level specifications are based.

It will be clear that on any particular occasion of meaning negotiation the more familiar the schematic content or mode of communication ,  the less reliance needs to be placed on systemic knowledge ,  and vice versa .  If ,  for example ,  I am engaged in reading a text on a subject in which I am well versed  ( where the ideational or content schema is familiar )  ,  which has been written in a manner conventionally associated with writing on this subject  ( where the interpersonal or formal schema is familiar )  ,  then I shall only need to pay attention to the linguistic signs to the extent that they key in this schematic knowledge and indicate how it is to be extended .  Many of the specific meanings which can be deciphered out of the symbol are not <head>activated</head> because they are not indexically required . This ,  of course ,  relates to the point made by Johnson - Laird earlier :  that an effective  ( i.e. indexical )  use of language does not depend on knowing precise  ( i.e. symbolically complete )  meanings .  On the other hand ,  if I encounter a text which deals with an unfamiliar content area and does so in accordance .  with communicative or rhetorical conventions which are new to me ,  then I obviously have to look much more closely at the language itself as a source of information as to what might be meant .

The question that  then needed to be answered was whether the dd  fusion was being induced by collisions within the hot plasma  thermonuclear fusion  or from some other non - thermonuclear processes such as collisions between deuterons that had been accelerated to high energies during the initial pulse of current and other deuterons of comparatively low energies .

According to Marslen - Wilson and Welsh ,  a set of potential word candidates  ( the cohort )  is activated during the earliest phases of the word recognition process solely on the basis of bottom - up sensory information .  That is ,  all words sharing the same initial sound characteristics become activated in the system .  As the system detects mismatches between initial bottom - up sensory information and the top - down information about the expected sound representation of words generated by context , inappropriate candidates within the initial cohort are de - <head>activated</head> . A word is said to be recognised at the point when a particular word can be uniquely distinguished from all other words in the cohort .

If the adventurers are successful in picking the lock , this trap wo n't be <head>activated</head> , but they will have to be very careful taking out the money without breaking the glass sphere ( no test needed , but you should roll dice as if you were making some secret test just to scare the players ) .

Indeed ,  for most of human history we have tended to do the reverse ,  to use the analogy of the human mind to explain what happens in the physical world ,  an approach known as animism .  By the seventeenth century ,  however ,  engineers had become sufficiently skilled at making complex mechanical devices ,  powered by clockwork or water ,  to be able to make toys that moved in a fairly convincing approximation to the way that people and animals move .  Some were constructed so that they would only move when a passing person <head>activated</head> a treadle of some sort so that the toy would suddenly spring into life . The French mathematician Descartes remarked on the similarity between this sort of toy and the behaviour of animals ,  arguing that the latter were nothing more than automatons whose reactions were constantly triggered by events in the environment  ( Jeannerod 1985 )  .  Not knowing about electricity ,  but knowing about hydraulic systems ,  Descartes suggested that the control of these reactions in animals was mediated by movements of fluids ,  initiated in the sensory nerves by stimuli ,  being carried to the ventricular system of the brain where contact was made with the motor nerves .

Indeed ,  their emotional behaviour was often exaggerated .  Papez therefore located the emotional behaviour mechanisms in the brainstem ,  especially in the mammillary bodies which ,  he believed ,  received sensory information via subcortical relay routes ,  and cognitive information from the cerebral cortex via the hippocampus and its subcortical projection system ,  the fornix .  Emotional experience , on the other hand , he thought was the result of <head>activating</head> specific areas of the cerebral cortex in much the same way as activating other areas produced visual or auditory experience . On the basis of some remarkably weak clinical evidence he decided that the site of emotional experience was the cingulate gyrus ,  which lies on the medial surface of the hemispheres .  All of the areas that Papez implicated in emotion are part of an anatomically identified system known  as the limbic system .

It is wrong because you can eliminate all of the possible sensory mechanisms that might detect the tissue disturbance produced by a particular form of deprivation and motivation still persists .  For example ,  cutting the nerve supply to the genitals does not interfere with sexual motivation in the short term ;  cutting the nerves to the stomach does not interfere with hunger .  This led Morgan ( 1943 ) to argue that drive must be due to <head>activating</head> a central nervous system mechanism that represents the drive state , much in the same way as Papez was claiming that activation of the cingulate cortex represented emotion . Morgan did not know where to locate the source of this central motive state in the nervous system .  It was Stellar  ( 1954 )  who put the finger on the hypothalamus as the seat of motivation ,  basing his arguments on a number of lesion studies that had shown quite specific disturbances of motivation after lesions in this region .

The system is designed so that it will learn to generate output patterns in response to input patterns .  It can do this because the capacity of an input neuron to activate any of the output neurons increases every time the output pattern generator activates the output neuron simultaneously with external activation of the input neuron .  After a number of such pairings a particular pattern of input will come to evoke a selected output pattern , without the output pattern generator being <head>activated</head> . Associative learning will have taken place .  This system is ,  by  definition ,  interactive since every input neuron can affect every output neuron .

This is most clearly seen in studies of the primate visual cortex  ( Maunsell and Newsome 1987 )  .  Visual field representations are mapped by sampling successive locations in the visual cortex with a microelectrode and ,  at each location ,  determining where you have to place a stimulus in the visual field to activate single cells at that location .  You find that cells in adjacent parts of the visual cortex are <head>activated</head> by stimulation in adjacent parts of the visual field . The cortex is said to be retinotopically mapped .

The HER - 2/neu  oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase ,  p185 erbB2    ( ref .  32 )  ,  which is structurally related to the EGF receptor and to erbB3  ( ref .  34 )  .  Additionally ,  p185 erbB2   is expressed on the surface of Schwann cells and is upregulated during wallerian degeneration and also by exposure to forskolin ,  which potentiates the mitogenic response to GGF .  As the recombinant GGFs described here and several putative p185 erbB2 ligands are products of the same gene , we reasoned that bovine pituitary GGFs and rhGGF - II might <head>activate</head> a p185 receptor tyrosine kinase ( perhaps erbB2 ) on Schwann cells . Therefore we analysed tyrosine phosphorylation of Schwann cell protein by western blotting  ( Fig. 3 )  .  This demonstrated that Schwann cells treated with either native or recombinant GGFs phosphorylated  ( on tyrosine )  a protein of 185K .

Using peptide sequence information derived from purified bovine glial growth factors ,  we have isolated several clones that encode Schwann cell mitogenic activities .  The group of proteins encoded by these transcripts includes the three described glial growth factors  ( ref .  22 ,  and A.D.J.G .  et al. ,   manuscript submitted )  and several proteins  ( heregulins and Neu differentiation factor )  that have various activities on cultured breast tumour cells .  The heregulins and NDF are specific activators of the p185 erbB2 receptor and rhGGF - II <head>activates</head> the phosphorylation of a Schwann cell protein that is similar in size to p185 erbB2 . Based on several lines of evidence ,  including the data presented here ,  we suggest that various p185 erbB2  ligands ,  such as the GGFs ,  are important in development ,  regeneration and tumour formation in the nervous system .  A critical stage in the development of the peripheral nervous system is the projection of axons to their targets ,  the ensheathment of these axons and their subsequent myelination by Schwann cells .

This is consistent with the idea that DNA binding and therefore transactivation by Myc requires association with Max  ( either Max1 or Max2 )  or at least the Max bHLH - Z domain  ( Max85 ;  Figs 1 and 2 a  )  .  Unlike VP16 - Myc  N ,  Max103 - VP16 by itself transactivates the CACGTG - CYC1 promoter  ( Fig. 2 b  )  .  Thus , Max can bind DNA in the absence of Myc but does not significantly <head>activate</head> transcription in our system unless tagged with a heterologous transactivation domain . Accordingly ,  all Max proteins tested  ( Fig. 1 )  bind DNA as homo - oligomers in yeast extracts  ( ref .  9 ,  and data not shown )  ,  as recently reported for bacterially expressed Max .  Transactivation of the CACGTG - CYC1 promoter is sequence - specific ,  as much less or no transactivation by Myc+Max  ( Fig. 2 a  ,  lanes a )  ,  VP16 - Myc  N+Max or Max103 - VP16  ( Fig. 2 b  )  is observed from a control reporter lacking the CACGTG binding site  ( see also Fig. 2 a  legend )  .

A purse - string mechanism based on a contractile cable fits the observations of others who have investigated embryonic wound healing and seen similar patterns of epidermal movement .  But it does not apply to minute epidermal lesions that leave the basal lamina intact ,  or to embryonic epidermal cells moving on a rigid adhesive substratum in culture :  here the conventional mechanism of epidermal crawling seems to operate .  Two central questions arise : what initiates the formation of the actin cable , and what <head>activates</head> its contraction and the associated cell rearrangements ? The experiments of Kolega are illuminating here .  Stress applied to a migrating epidermal cell at right angles to its direction of movement  ( tangential to the leading edge of its lamellipodium )  causes the lamellipodium to retract and brings about a reorganization of the cell 's  actin into a cable oriented along the major axis of stress .

These findings ,  together with our previous observation of an unidentified   t   - resistant PLC in HL - 60 granulocytes and our unpublished observation that purified PLC -   1  showed no response to   t  ,  strongly suggest that the stimulation of PLC -  2  by   t  is specific for members of the PLC -    subfamily and is isozyme - selective within this group of PLCs .  Clearly , PLC - 1 is <head>activated</head> by all four members of the q family ( q , 11 , 14 , and 16 ) . PLC -  2  seems to be resistant to stimulation by   q  ,   11  ,   and  14  ,   but sensitive to stimulation by  16    ( refs 9 ,  10 )  .  Our finding that both PLC -  1  and PLC -  2  are stimulated by   subunits strongly suggests that these PLCs ,  similar to the type II and IV adenylyl cyclases ,  are regulated by both G protein  -   and   subunits .

The significance of these protocols is that synchronized firing patterns at similar frequencies occur in the hippocampus during learning .  )  LTP is characterized by three basic properties :  cooperativity ,  associativity and input - specificity .  Cooperativity describes the existence of an intensity threshold for induction ; weak tetani , <head>activating</head> relatively few afferent fibres , do not trigger LTP . The threshold for inducing LTP is a complex function of the intensity and pattern of tetanic stimulation ;  between weak trains which produce only PTP and strong trains which induce LTP ,  lies an intermediate range of activation which engages STP .  LTP is associative in the sense that a weak input can be potentiated if it is active at the same time as a strong tetanus to a separate but convergent input .

The properties of cooperativity ,  associativity and input - specificity can now easily be explained .  The cooperativity threshold follows from the need for depolarization to reduce the level of the Mg 2+  block of the NMDA channel .  Weak stimuli , activating only a few fibres , fail to induce LTP not because insufficient L - glutamate is released to <head>activate</head> NMDA receptors , but because the level of depolarization provided by the weak input does not produce an adequate reduction of the Mg 2+ block . When many fibres are activated in synchrony by a strong stimulus ,  depolarization spreads between neighbouring synapses to enhance the unblocking of NMDA channels .  Associativity has a similar explanation except that the required depolarization is provided by a different set of afferent fibres ;  in theory ,  these helper inputs could use any neurotransmitter that promotes depolarization ,  and ,  experimentally ,  depolarization is often provided by injecting current into the cell .

But the selectivity of H - 7 for potentiated pathways has been challenged ,  and other PKC inhibitors that act on the catalytic subunit ,  including K - 252b  ( ref .  85 )  ,  are not able to depotentiate fully established LTP .  There is also disagreement as to whether the sustained kinase activity that might be necessary for LTP is located within the postsynaptic cell or not. A recent view is that a postsynaptic kinase is <head>activated</head> transiently ( for less than a few minutes following the tetanus ) and a presynaptic kinase is activated for longer periods ( but for less than 1 hour ) . These kinases might be the   and   isoforms of PKC ,  respectively .  Intracellular injection of the catalytic subunit of PKC induces synaptic potentiation as does the extracellular application of activators of PKC ,  such as certain phorbol esters .

This unsaturated fatty acid satisfies several of the requirements for a retrograde messenger :   ( 1 )  it is released from cultured neurons into the extracellular medium by the activation of NMDA receptors ,   ( 2 )  there is an increase in its efflux and postsynaptic availability following the induction of LTP ,   ( 3 )  inhibitors of phospholipase A 2  ,  an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid from phospholipids ,  block the induction of LTP r134135  ,  and  ( 4 )  the transient application of arachidonic acid to hippocampal synapses causes a slow - onset potentiation .  Potential targets for arachidonic acid include not only the presynaptic terminal ,  where it may act to increase L - glutamate release ,  but also glial cells where it depresses L - glutamate uptake and the postsynaptic cell ,  where ,  for example ,  it can potentiate NMDA receptor - mediated currents .  Another phospholipase A 2 - derived lipid , platelet - <head>activating</head> factor , also has some of the properties expected of a retrograde messenger .

The amplified Ca 2+  signal ,  in association with the other activators of protein kinases  ( zig - zag arrows )  ,  then leads to the phosphorylation of substrate proteins including ,  probably ,  AMPA and NMDA receptors .  Other enzymes , such as nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) , if present , may also be <head>activated</head> by the Ca 2+ transient . Biochemical changes in the presynaptic terminal may be initiated by the action of retrograde messengers ,  such as arachidonic acid  ( AA )  ,  nitric oxide  ( NO )  and K +  ,  perhaps in conjunction with the action of L - glutamate on presynaptic mGluRs .

Walkinshaw HUMAN cyclophilin A  ( CypA )  ,  a ubiquitous intracellular protein of 165 amino acids ,  is the major receptor for the cyclic undecapeptide immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A  ( CsA )  ,  which prevents allograft rejection after transplant surgery and is efficacious in the field of autoimmune diseases .  CsA prevents T - cell proliferation by blocking the calcium - <head>activated</head> pathway leading to interleukin - 2 transcription . Besides their ability to bind CsA ,  the cyclophilin isoforms also have peptidyl - prolyl isomerase activity and enhance the rate of protein folding .  The macrolide FK506 acts similarly to CsA and its cognate receptor FKBP also has peptidyl - prolyl isomerase activity .

In modern China an attempt has also been made to create a national art ,  in this instance by partly discrediting tradition .  In 1942 Lu Hsun was quoted by Mao Tse - tung as asserting that the aim of a modern Chinese artist should be :  By selection to accept the historical legacy of Chinese traditional art ;  to absorb the best style and technique from foreign art ;  and thus to establish a new national art in accordance with the demands and needs of the masses .  Mao <head>added</head> : To study the development of this old culture , to reject its feudal dross and assimilate its democratic essence , is a necessary condition of our new national culture . The critical distinction between feudal dross and democratic essence subsequently proved difficult to make .  This brief diversion into the cultural and political history of Germany ,  the USSR and China has been made to emphasise the way that a state may determine artistic production ,  and thence art criticism .

Catholics ,  however ,  did not vote for the Unionist Party.

One can also <head>add</head> that there is something in the present policies of the SDLP which suggest a need to maintain a somewhat fragile unity in respect of the national question . Seamus Mallon ,  MP of the SDLP may have seen the Hillsborough agreement of 1985 as a step towards a united Ireland ,  but some of his co - politicians in the party would not share that view .

The rough insiders are on the walls ,  defending God 's  true believers from Romanism and immorality .

Despite Buckley 's  reluctance to play up the siege of Derry as a key myth and his preference for general categories of interpretation derived from various historical experiences ,  it does seem that the siege has particular significance .

On the other hand ,  there was the nationalist theory of democracy ,  which derives power from the people and not from an lite group of religious intellectuals .  The next section will show the way in which this contradiction continued to be shared by a large number of clergy and laity even into the 1980s .  It should be <head>added</head> here that the high clergy hardly recognized that they had actually been exercising a political religious power of a specifically sectarian or monopolistic type . Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate ,  they meant they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state .

The two Roman catholic priests ,  who were in all respects dedicated pastors and much liked by many in the local community ,  immediately opposed the idea ,  preaching against it at Sunday masses in the local convent and the school hall .

The curate <head>added</head> to this that those promoting the integrated project were in fact promoting secularism . The fact that a prominent member of the current community council and an integrated education supporter was a member of official Sinn Fein ,  the Workers '  party ,  appeared to figure in the reasoning ,  as this party has always been suspected to be an anti - clerical and secularist force .  In residents '  association meetings ,  the clergy 's  point of view received vocal support from one or two members of the older village community which preceded the housing estate .

Not unnaturally one consequence of this reductionism is that action and pragmatism take on an extra dimension in the police mind ,  holding a special place in the institutional imagination .

A heavy contact to the opponent 's  face may not merit just a verbal warning ;  after consultation with the other members of the panel ,  the referee can go directly to a full point penalty or even a disqualification .  In some cases the disqualification is not only from a particular event within a tournament ,  but from the whole tournament .  The second thing to note is that each offence carries its own scale of penalties , and penalties for one offence are not <head>added</head> on to penalties imposed for a different offence . Thus if I incur a verbal warning for stepping out of the area ,  I do n't then expect to receive a half - point penalty for a slight contravention of another rule.

Behind the indecision lay a youth torn in one direction by the family business ,  not least perhaps his father 's  shadow hanging over him ;  and the preferences of his mind and ever prolific imagination in the other. Accordingly , he read arts in his first year ; commerce ( which included accounting , commercial law , political science and a couple of doses of mathematics ) in his second ; arts ( though strangely retaining political science ) for his third and fourth years , to which was <head>added</head> zoology . The choices are both a reflection of his inner confusion ,  and a statement of his determination to let his curiosity run wherever it would  -  and that long before mixed courses were popular .  The results confirm that he could have done very much better ,  but his mind was partly elsewhere ,  ever active ,  ever engaged ,  ever busy .

It lay along the  lines of Layton 's  understanding of the poetic function  which exists somewhere between fact and imagination ,  as Eli Mandel said of him. Not pure fact ,  not meretricious research ,  which observes and tames the insightful - prophetic thrust ;  not mere imagination or mental excitement  but the fruitful intercourse between the two ,  in an artistic equilibrium .  Leonard could be fastidious to the nth degree in completing his own work he has always said that he works one word at a time , and can spend months , even years , in <head>adding</head> finesse to it ; he is nevertheless dismissive of anything approaching scholarly exactitude , still more so pedantry . It is not clear where this comes from .  There is certainly an element which highly values the proprieties of artistic freedom :  a work of art must be a work of free spirit ,  untrammelled by rules and regulations ,  wherein absolute consistency  or conformity of any sort  is out of place .

It was this work ,  along with the subsequent brilliance of his public performances ,  that created his reputation as Canada 's  leading young poet :  His virtues are his own ,  and they are considerable at his best he expresses himself ,  sometimes whimsically ,  sometimes passionately ,  in speech which is beyond the capacity of mere formula to produce ,  commented Allan Donaldson at the time .  Mr Cohen knows how to turn a phrase ,  his poems at their best have a clean ,  uncluttered line ,  and he writes about something ,   said Milton Wilson .  Easily the most promising , judged Pacey , in 1961 ; and George Woodcock <head>added</head> that Leonard was one who could write lines which are no longer good imitation Yeats ; they are lines which only Yeats could have imitated . A fresh and exciting talent a brilliant beginning ,  commented the anonymous reviewer in the Queen 's  Quarterly  .  All of this he offered in a variety of poetic forms ,  from the traditional quatrain to the more controversial prose - poem Friends .

For such ,  God only frowns on the world ,  and stirs it to judgment ;  the butterfly cannot break loose into flight ;  it merely expires ,  as Leonard expressed it ,  ending its life in three flag - swept days.

It is also advisable to take a vitamin B supplement to aid in the digestion of the carbohydrate .  Once the carbohydrate has been consumed it is stored as glycogen in the muscles and stays there until it is required for energy .  This storage of glycogen in the muscles <head>adds</head> to the overall size of the muscles . Once training is underway the glycogen is gradually removed from the muscles to produce energy and is replaced by blood ,  that is the muscles are pumped .  After training has finished the blood supply is reduced and the pump disappears ,  resulting in the muscle being smaller than before the exercise started .

In mainland Europe the spacing between tracks and reversible signalling enables engineers to work on one track in complete safety while traffic continues to pass on the other. Here the engineers have to carry out most of their work on Sundays when traffic is light ,  but this often entails diversions and extended journey times followed by temporary speed restrictions for a few further days at the beginning of each week .  To compensate for these temporary speed restrictions additional recovery time is <head>added</head> to daytime schedules . Following studies by Eastern Region 's  engineers ,  a new tracklaying strategy was introduced in 1987 whereby  with the use of a new machine called the Dynamic Track Stabiliser  tracks could be handed back by 06.00 on Monday morning at the full 125mph line speed ,  eliminating the need for a temporary speed restriction and associated recovery time allowance .  Removal of these recovery allowances made possible a general acceleration of East Coast 125mph services from May 1987 .

The stereotyped Spanish style is possibly seen at its best in Petipa 's  Don Quixote  ,  most particularly in the famous pas de deux  fur the ballerina and her partner .

The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and ,  when needed ,  help to create the atmosphere and mood of the whole .

There is a major difference between real ale and keg beer .  Keg ,  which includes lager ,  is known in the industry as brewery conditioned beer .  Instead of a secondary fermentation in the cask to <head>add</head> a full , mature palate , keg beers are killed off in the brewery by filtration , chilling and pasteurisation . The aim is to produce beers that are sterile ,  have a long shelf life and are highly profitable .  In the case of keg milds and bitters when fermentation is complete they are conditioned for a short period under gas pressure and are then filtered to remove yeast solids and pasteurised .

The sugars dissolve into the water and the sweet liquid ,  called wort ,  is pumped to a copper .  The flowers of the hop plant add bitterness to beer and the oils in the plant also guard against any infections during the brewing process .  As the wort is boiled in the copper with the hops many brewers also <head>add</head> sugars , such as glucose or cereal syrup , to encourage a strong fermentation . CAMRA would prefer beer to be brewed solely from barley malt but the use of sugar dates back to the 19th century and many renowned beers ,  such as Marston 's  Pedigree ,  have recipes that include 10 per cent or more brewing sugars .  When the hopped wort has been cooled it is run to fermenting vessels where it meets its destiny with yeast .

When the hopped wort has been cooled it is run to fermenting vessels where it meets its destiny with yeast .  The type of yeast strain used for ale is known as top fermenting .  It works at a warm temperature and vigorously turns the sugars in the wort into alcohol and carbon dioxide , producing at the same time ripe fruity aromas that <head>add</head> to the pleasure of ale drinking . The great head of yeast created during fermentation is cropped off and after a week the remaining yeast is overcome by the alcohol it has produced and sinks to the bottom of the fermenter .  The liquid is now officially called beer but it needs a few days further conditioning in the brewery ,  to purge some of the rough alcohols ,  before it is ready to leave for the pub .

Unfortunately releasing these into the wort requires mutually  incompatable  conditions .  Flavours rapidly evaporate from hot wort while bitterness requires up to an hour to fully develop .  Brewers have been aware of this issue for centuries and have developed the practice of <head>adding</head> copper hops early in the boil to provide bitterness and aroma or late hops towards the end of the boil for flavour . While whole hops are repeatedly claimed to produce the best hop character in a beer ,  problems may be encountered .  First is the liability of hops to deterioration by oxygen in the air .

To loose them off together ,  scatter - gun fashion :  Stavrogin says I am making this statement ,  incidentally ,  to prove I am in full possession of my mental faculties and understand my position ;  I want to forgive myself ,  this is my chief aim ,  my whole aim ;  I want everyone to look at me ;  I fall back on this as my last resource ;  The thing about me then was I felt bored with life ,  sick and tired of it ;  I am seeking boundless suffering ;  I took it into my head to mutilate my life somehow  ( not necessarily the same thing as seeking suffering ,  any more than seeking suffering need entail accepting it )  .  Let us pause for a moment over I want everyone to look at me .  And I would also like to <head>add</head> yet another reason to the already formidable pile , which is that Stavrogin intends a challenge to society . Now the first is one of Dostoevsky 's  alterations to the galley proofs of At Tikhon 's  ,  and the  second is a variant recorded by his widow .  I draw attention to their provenance because commentators have focused on the family - magazine question ,  on the attempt ,  that is ,  to get the chapter past Katkov in some shape or form ,  and I think this is only half the story .

Very few readers will notice this discrepancy ,  but all are flicked and jabbed at and irritated  those circling insects  by contradiction ,  by undetermination followed by overdetermination of reasons ,  by the narrator 's  fuss over details which do n't matter ,  his youthful sententiousness about women  ( the depths of the female heart )  and other irrelevancies ,  his moralizing ,  his way of wantonly bleeding a robust narrative with However ,  that may only have seemed so ,  his I have already described when he has n't ,  his promises to explain later which are n't kept when the reader does n't want explanation anyhow ,  he wants the story .  Once and once only in six hundred and seventeen pages the narrator gives his readership a disconcerting ,  impertinent prod by addressing it directly as Gentlemen .  These things <head>add</head> up. They add up to a novel of leaking secrets and amputated thoughts ,  of wildly comic material sometimes dully ,  almost dutifully deployed ,  as if the humour had escaped the teller ;  of people missing each other in dialogue Perhaps he did n't go out of his mind at all .

The voltages in  (  C3 ,  C2 ,  and C1  )  ,  each charge CL  through two diodes in series ,  but the charging path through C4  has only one diode ,  D11  .

You can change the output voltage by <head>adding</head> or subtracting sections ; C1 , D1 , D3 , and D2 constitute one section , for example .

However ,  the weaker the magnetic field ,  the lower the frequency needed for a given ion mass .  The weaker the AC electric field ,  the longer it takes to build up the power of those ions ,  but the build - up is unavoidable if the particle mass ,  the magnetic field strength and the AC signal frequency satisfy the formula for resonance .  In a cyclotron the energy of the particles is deployed into an orderly spiral motion around the axis of the magnetic field and the pumping action of that weak pulsating electric field progressively <head>adds</head> to that energy and causes a pressure build - up at confining surfaces as the particles are driven in spirals of larger radius . A cyclotron is fine - tuned to a resonant frequency specific to one chosen ion type .

In America fashion can actually be enforced .

A year or so later I chanced to meet him and he acknowledged that this was just criticism ,  but that he had been obliged to insert these names so that his book would look like a truly up - to - date ,  intouch work of scholarship .

The contradiction has long been lived with in practice ,  and students become adept in faking responses .  Nevertheless ,  it points to a flaw in the aesthetic defence of literary education ,  and one which implicitly encourages culturalist claims to take it over .  I should <head>add</head> that my own understanding of literature is largely in aesthetic terms ; at least , of poetry ; where fiction and drama are concerned , aesthetic approaches can , at best , only be partial . The idea of aesthetic education ,  as formulated by Schiller ,  seems an entirely noble one ;  the difficulty is in accommodating it to contemporary pedagogy .

By JOHN PIENAAR ,  Political Correspondent PENNED - IN by steel barriers between a noisy crowd of gay liberationists and the lonely emissary of the oppressed African Dinkas ,  few of the street - corner causes besieging this week 's  conference seem as hopeless as the campaign for Labour to organise in Ulster .  About 15 mainly Protestant and professional Belfast - based activists have made the trip to Brighton this year , <head>adding</head> their voices to the clamour as the largely indifferent stream of Labour delegates pours from the conference centre at lunchtime . The speaking invitation to Gerry Adams ,  the Sinn Fein president and MP for West Belfast ,  and vague expectations that a Tory Party branch may be recognised in North Down ,  have provided little encouragement of a parallel shift by Labour .  It is an absolute bloody shame that the Labour Party wo n't take this thing seriously ,  David Morrison ,  45 ,  a systems analyst and secretary of the campaign of 200 - 300 members ,  said .

If we allow public spending to grow consistently faster than growth in output ,  then either public borrowing has to be increased or taxation ,  he said during a debate on the policy review report Economic Equality .  John Smith was right to tell the country that a Labour government will only spend what it can afford .  This commitment brings credibility to our social programmes and <head>adds</head> to Labour 's electability . Opening the debate ,  Mr Smith did not return to this theme but dwelt on the pathways out of poverty proposed in the review ,  notably the introduction of a statutory minimum wage and the restoration of a link between pensions and average earnings .  Initially the minimum wage would be 50 per cent of male median earnings .

The magazine calls for a retrial on the grounds of the new evidence of the alleged Mail on Sunday payment ,  the excessive amount of damages awarded ,  and misdirection of the jury by the judge on the amount of aggravated damages they could award .  After listening to Mr Lightman 's  allegations ,  Lord Donaldson said that if Mr Oliver 's  affidavit was to be believed then The Mail on Sunday had acted in a wholly hypocritical way .  On the amount of damages , Mr Lightman said the Court of Appeal had a special responsibility to bear in mind the dangerous precedent which could be set by such awards , and <head>added</head> that in this case the award was out of all proportion to the alleged libel . He added :  No real crime was alleged in the libel .  It was not in a national newspaper .

Manchester United .  .  0 Portsmouth .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  0  ( United win 3 - 2 on agg )  THE NEWS for England is excellent .  Bryan Robson ,  doubtful for the World Cup match against Poland 24 hours ago ,  returned for United last night to cruise for 20 minutes before erupting into Captain Marvel ,  never shirking a tackle and being denied two goals only by the crossbar and a brilliant diving save from Alan Knight .  The news for United 's vast following is less euphoric ; a subdued crowd of 26,698 , the backlash to the Derby defeat , saw them fail to <head>add</head> to the three goals of the first leg . Portsmouth must take some of the blame for the stalemate for they came defensively formed and defensively minded ,  and content to rely on breakaways to snatch an equaliser and ,  faintly possibly ,  a winner .  They almost achieved the former on the stroke of injury - time when Kevin Ball headed against the underside of Jim Leighton 's  bar .

A successful team may have to go through a number of fights during the course of a day 's  competition so it is not at all unusual to see teams short - handed through injury in the final stages .  Never be tempted to forfeit the last two bouts of a male team match ,  or the last bout of a female team match if you have already seen your team take the deciding first three/two victories .  Although the opposing team has no chance of <head>winning</head> , any attempt to withdraw your remaining team - member ( s ) may well be rewarded by disqualification of the entire team for bad sportsmanship . Sometimes an event is at first delayed but then things happen fast .  Should this occur ,  a team which is relaxing may find itself out of earshot when their name is called .

Our game really is in danger of dying from too much of it .  You cannot blame a brilliant young player who takes ,  say ,  the 200,000 he or she is offered ,  to play just for one night but it inevitably gives them a  totally false impression of life and what their tennis priorities ought to be .  But when you have a situation where youngsters of 12 or 13 and in some cases even younger who may only have <head>won</head> a couple of matches , are being offered 500,000 guarantees to sign up with one of the management companies before they are snapped up by one of the rival agents , the potential for long term damage is enormous . This year ,  in prize money alone ,  there is well over 100m available for professional players round the world ,  including team events such as The David Cup and The Federation Cup .  And that is before you start taking into consideration commercial endorsements and appearance money which ,  at a conservative guess must add at least another 3040m .

But , if Hammersmith <head>wins</head> and the deals are declared legal , the council will have to pay the losses on the transactions .

The council had wound down its holdings from 5bn to 2bn but its advisers had backed the wrong horse by predicting low interest rates .

Only on the final climb of Sally Gap did he clinch victory as his rival ,  Gary Baker ,  was struggling back from two punctures .  Kelly , who has <head>won</head> this race three times , said : It has been a very long and hard season for me , and I feel very tired . Still ,  the best man won .

Only a week ago ,  he was in New York beating the world champion ,  Abdi Bile ,  and the best of the rest at this distance .  Nobody remotely approaching that calibre threatened him yesterday .  Having <head>won</head> two of this series in the fastest times already , he would have had to finish four seconds behind the steeplechaser Mark Rowland to lose the first prize of 5,000 . Elliott was not entirely satisfied .  He hoped to surpass Cram 's  fastest mile time of the year to remove the last argument against his own selection ,  but after two laps of inadequate pacing ,  he was never in prospect .

Rugby Union :  Bowling swings it for Llanelli By JIM HILL Llanelli . . . . . . . 27 Leicester . . . . . . . 8 GOING for the gap took on a painful new meaning for Steve Bowling when he helped Llanelli claw their way back to <head>win</head> this entertaining game . In scoring the try which restored Llanelli 's  lead and waning confidence deep in the second half ,  the left wing Bowling got an accidental boot in the mouth .  It left him dazed ,  bleeding profusely and minus a front tooth .

In many of these countries the new respect for human rights was embodied in the repeal or revision of laws used to imprison prisoners of conscience .  But there are still prisoners of conscience in Europe ,  and in every other region of the world .  39 of the prisoners featured in the letter <head>writing</head> campaign have been released ; about 50 remain in prison . None of these people should ever have been prisoners of conscience .  Our task today is to increase the international pressure on behalf of the thousands of prisoners of conscience all over the world ,  to make tomorrow the day their freedom is restored .

Tiao Sisoumang Sisaleumsak and Houmphanh Norasing ,  both detained since 1975 ,  are among 33 detainees still held in Laos '  northeastern province of Houa Phanh .  Their living conditions are harsh with poor provision of housing ,  food and medicines .  The South Korean authorities <head>wrote</head> to AI in response to its appeals for imprisoned artist Hong Song - dam and publisher Chang Ui - gyun . The authorities said that Hong Song - dam was not imprisoned merely for sending his paintings to North Korea and books to Koreans in Germany ,  but because his paintings and contributions to a magazine Art Movement  were aimed at promoting a Marxist - Leninist revolution .  In September 1990 the Supreme Court dismissed the charges of espionage and returned the case to a lower court .

Yours respectfully and sincerely ,  ALISON HENDERSON .  Your Excellency ,  I am <head>writing</head> as I 'm puzzled as to why you have released Kim Hyun - hui who planted a bomb on a plane and killed 115 people but have imprisoned a girl for taking part in a peace march . To me this is odd as if I were the president of South Korea I would have imprisoned Kim Hyun - hui and released Im Su Kyong as to me Kim Hyun - hui committed the more serious crime .  I would like this to be explained to me as I just do n't understand it .

Books and catalogues may contain criticism ;  but their writers may think of themselves as art historians ,  philosophers ,  aestheticians ,  anthropologists ,  historians or biographers ,  and there are many other possibilities ;  their books may never be identified as art criticism .  As the following chapters will show ,  the useful and helpful functions of art criticism will receive preference in the choice of what is quoted or discussed .  Is the text or part of the text <head>written</head> so that a reader will benefit in a future encounter with a work of art ? Some writing which is called art criticism will be helpful ,  some will not ;  other writing will also be valuable ,  although whether it can be described as art criticism may be disputable .

ART CRITICISM AND ART HISTORY Do art historians write about the past ,  while art critics write about the present ?  Things are not so simple , as some art historians <head>write</head> well about the present , with a generosity of feeling and approach enriching to contemporary culture . They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,  partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .  Meyer Schapiro ,  who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,  was an open - minded historian of this sort .

By the 1850s the tradition had declined ,  so that Baudelaire was seeking to give new life to a decayed literary genre .  He asserted that a modern artist should be in tune with his times ,  careful to avoid hackneyed subjects .  Typically , a laudatory essay he <head>wrote</head> was called The Painter of Modern Life on the subject of the illustrator Constantin Guys ; this gifted if minor artist was accurately targeted by Baudelaire as being in the mainstream of contemporary social and political life . Guys '  drawings appeared in such papers as the Illustrated London News  ,  a very successful venture begun in 1842 ,  the decade which also saw the founding of satirical journals like  Punch  or Kladderadatsch  .  The illustrated periodical was a phenomenon of a world which Baudelaire saw as reborn on Guys '  paper :

Between these two ridges the fire of the sunset falls along the trough of the sea ,  dyeing it with an awful but glorious light ,  the intense and lurid splendour which burns like gold ,  and bathes like blood .  Along this fiery path and valley ,  the tossing waves by which the swell of the sea is restlessly divided ,  lift themselves in dark ,  indefinite ,  fantastic forms ,  each casting a faint and ghastly shadow behind it along the illumined foam Purple and blue , the lurid shadows of the hollow breakers are cast upon the mist of night , which gathers cold and low , advancing like the shadow of death upon the guilty ship as it labours amid the lightening of the sea , its thin mast <head>written</head> upon the sky , in lines of blood I believe ,  if I were reduced to rest Turner 's  immortality upon any single work ,  I should choose this .  Its daring conception ,  ideal in the highest sense of the word ,  is based on the purest truth ,  and wrought out with the concentrated knowledge of a life ,  its colour is almost perfect ,  not one false or morbid hue in any part or line ,  and so modulated that every square inch of canvas is a perfect composition ;  its drawing is as accurate as fearless ;  the ship buoyant ,  bending ,  and full of motion ;  its tones as true as they are wonderful ;  and the whole picture dedicated to the most sublime of subjects and impressions the power ,  majesty and deathfulness of the open ,  deep ,  illimitable sea .

Beneath a sultry sky ,  at four o'clock ,  the island ,  boats slipping past its flank ,  stirring with a casual Sunday crowd enjoying the fresh air among the trees ;  and these forty or so figures are endowed with a succinct ,  hieratic line The atmosphere is transparent and uncommonly vibrant ;  the surface seems to flicker or glimmer .  Fnon , like other excellent critics , was a valued friend of artists , and so he remained all his life even though he gave up <head>writing</head> criticism after a decade of working on the Revue blanche from 1893 to 1903 . He accepted a position in a dealer 's  gallery ,  where Matisse was among the artists who benefited from his judgement .  A thumbnail sketch by a friend brings Fnon to life :  He did not thrust himself upon you .

Alfred Barr ,  the first director of the Museum of Modern Art ,  New York ,  is exemplary .  In 1936 ,  for example ,  the Museum put on two crucially important exhibitions ,  on Cubist and Abstract Art  ,  and Fantastic Art ,  Dada ,  Surrealism  .  For the latter catalogue Barr chose the Surrealist writer Georges Hugnet to <head>write</head> a historical essay , but it was Barr 's intelligent advocacy and choice of works that made the show such a significant affair . In place of the aggressive approach of the early years of Surrealism itself ,  Barr 's  commentary is in moderated phrases pointing to similarities between Surrealism and works firmly within the tradition of Western art :  The explanation of the kind of art shown in this exhibition may be sought in the deep - seated and persistent interest which human beings have in the fantastic ,  the irrational ,  the spontaneous ,  the marvellous ,  the enigmatic ,  and the dreamlike .

On Dada he wrote :  With robust iconoclastic  humor  the Dadaists mocked what they considered the sorry shams of European culture .  They even attacked art  especially modern art  but while they made fun of the pre - War Cubists ,  Expressionists and futurists ,  they borrowed and transformed many of the principles and techniques of these earlier movements .  Barr , in what used to be a general policy for museum curators , was not <head>writing</head> a passionate defence of the work his museum exhibited . Rather ,  the Museum does not intend to sponsor a particular aspect of modern art ,  but rather to make a report to the public by offering material for study and comparison .  Barr 's  European equivalents flourished in the 1950s rather than the  1930s  Jean Cassou at the Muse d'Art Moderne in Paris ,  Wilhelm Sandberg at the Stedlijk in Amsterdam ,  Pontus Hulten at the Modern Museum in Stockholm and then at the Pompidou Centre in Paris .

My aim was to investigate the symptoms of decay and perhaps to discover in the capriciousness and the return to chaos a law which would vouchsafe one an insight into the intimate workings of art .  This ,  I confess ,  is to me the real aim of art history .  In 1964 Peter Murray <head>wrote</head> an introduction to a new edition , in which he made an observation about the passage on Bernini 's St Teresa , the sculptural group in Rome which is a key work of the Baroque : Bernini is evidently attempting to render something quite transcendental and something which had never been attempted by a sculptor before that date .  Indeed ,  it is possible to argue that St Teresa 's  mystical ecstasies are themselves something entirely new in the spiritual life of Europe

More informal guidance can be found in books with a personal approach ,  in which class the Companion Guide to Rome  by Georgina Masson is exemplary  ( first published in 1965 )  .  There is adequate historical data about the Sistine Chapel ,  but there is also a personal response :  More , probably , has been <head>written</head> about this great hall - like chapel than any other building in the world ; but in fact no description , picture or photograph conveys the impact which it makes . Perhaps the first ,  and in the end the most lasting ,  impression that one carries away ,  is of the contrast between the golden - cream light and space and the exquisite feeling of harmony engendered by the ceiling as opposed to the deep blue darkness and turmoil of the Last Judgment .  Georgina Masson 's  special gift was her ability to disentangle and evoke in Rome three different cities ,  of Classical Antiquity ,  of the Renaissance ,  and of the Baroque .

How beautiful ,  how devoid of everything like the handicraft of art it is  the largeness ,  and yet ingenuity of its effect  the purity of its colour  the truth ,  yet refinement and elegance of the action ,  particularly of the hands  ( in which he particularly excels )  ;  and then ,  a lesson to all high - minded slovens ,  the patient vigilance with which the whole is linked together ,  by touches ,  in some instances small almost as a miniature ,  but like the sparkling of water .  Diaries are perhaps more often a vehicle for complaints .  Here is an American artist <head>writing</head> about his dismay at the work he saw at Paris in 1831 : Although I had been informed that the present French artists were low in merit ,  I did not expect to find them ,  with little exception ,  so totally devoid of it .  I was disgusted in the beginning with their subjects .

On the engraving of the picture made by Gisbert van Geen in 1588 ,  for which Pozzoferrato supplied the ornamental framework and  which Ridolfi reproduced in his biography ,  Tintoretto is described as being seventy years old .  According to this the picture must have been painted about 1588 ,  with which the style and the age of the sitter agree. From a letter to Francesco Gonzaga , <head>written</head> in 1622 and published by A. Luzio , in which among others a self - portrait of Tintoretto is offered to him , Pittalunga argues that the Paris picture may have been the one mentioned and which formed part of Rubens 's estate . This sort of reading is only for the dedicated follower of the history of taste ,  though any reader particularly interested in a picture may find within a single catalogue entry an acutely discriminating judgement or interesting facts ;  for example ,  Tietze 's  entry also points out that Manet so much admired the Tintoretto self - portrait that he made a copy of it .  The catalogue raisonn continues to be a key document for authentication of an artist 's  work .

The facilities available for television training differs from school to school ;  filming and television work is expensive to organise ,  and really there is not so much opportunity as one would like to see for students to gain experience in these vital areas .  However ,  where facilities are available for use over short periods of time ,  the rudiments of camera acting are taught in a structured way .  ( Some schools have been able to co - ordinate work with the National Film School , where a script has been <head>written</head> for the personalities in a group and then filmed on location , and this worked effectively . ) But it 's  true to say that most actors feel their drama school training has left them inadequately prepared for working in television and film by the time they graduate .

If an agent is interested in you he may well have useful comments on the photo you send of yourself ,  on your style and how you present yourself .

The drama school will give you some advice on when and where to <head>write</head> to , and how you organise your letters , but outside advice is very important in helping you to see yourself in perspective .

It will be up to you to <head>write</head> constantly and make contacts everywhere and you will largely be responsible for yourself . You always have your agent to refer to should anyone make you an offer .  If you have had problems finding an agent ,  you might consider the possibility of applying to join a co - operative where actors work together and run their own agency .
